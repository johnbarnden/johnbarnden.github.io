<TITLE> General Metaphoricity Signals </TITLE>

<BODY>

<H1>
POSSIBLE SIGNALS OF METAPHORICITY 
<BR>
not linked to any particular conceptual metaphor 
</H1>


<H2>
Acknowledgment
</H2>

The list is inspired by Andrew Goatly's book "The language of metaphors"
(Routledge, 1997),<BR> though  significant additions and reorganizations have been effected.

<! see file metaphoricity-signals.further-sources for additional ideas>


<H2>
Important Notes
</H2>


<UL>
<LI>
The phrases/devices in this file are for detecting only *some*
metaphorical utterances.  
<! Many, and probably most, metaphorical
utterances will not include these signals. The proportion that will
remains to be determined. We may be able to get an idea of it through
the current data collection project.>

<P><LI>
   The signals  may signal metaphoricity usefully
   often, but  may often not do so: many of them have
   useful functions in NON-metaphorical language. 

   <P>
   Question marks indicate the particularly dubious signals.

<P><LI> Obvious grammatical variants of the signals shown are implicitly
included, such as putting verbs within them into past tense or passive
voice. Thus, variants of "see as" include "seen as" and "saw
as". Exercise: think of other grammatical variants for this example, and
think about variants for other signals below.

<P><LI>
Double parentheses are used below to indicate a device or class of
     phrases without actually exhibiting it/them.
E.g. ((adjective)) means any adjective.

<P><LI>
A slash is used to indicate alternatives, as you might have guessed!

<P><LI>
Square brackets are used to indicate optional bits.

   <P>
   NB: "[some/a] sort of" covers the following:
 
    <UL>
    <LI>
            sort of
    <LI>
            some sort of
    <LI>
            a sort of

THE SIGNALS 
</H2>

 (largely from Goatly Chapter 6, but not including all of his, 
  and mostly not following his categorization)


<P><BR>
<H4>
Explicit signals of metaphoricity, similarity, etc. 
<BR> (where the signals themselves are not (very) metaphorical )
</H4>

<P>NB: The ones that allude to language could also be regarded as being
in the "Metalinguistic" category below.
</P>


<BR> metaphor[ical[ly]] [speaking]
<BR> figurative[ly] [speaking]
<BR> analogous[ly], analogy, analog[ue]
<BR> similarly, similar [to], simulacrum
<BR> compared to
<BR> symbol[ic[ally]], 
<BR> proverbial[ly]
<BR> allegory/ical[ly]
<BR> version

<BR>
<BR> ? fake, bogus, artificial, imitation, mock, pretend{ADJ}

<BR> 
<BR> in [much/somewhat/...] the same way
<BR> in a similar way
<BR> ? in this/that way, in these/those ways, ?? thus
<BR> ? to put it another way

<BR>
<BR> equivalent [of], equivalently
<BR> correspond[ing[ly]]

<BR> 
<BR> liken ... to
<BR> symbolize

<BR> 
<BR> alike
<BR> [quite/bit/somewhat/much/little/almost/very/...] like 

<BR>
  {where "like" is an adjective, adverb or preposition, and excluding
   cases where it is followed by certain things, e.g. pronouns.
   <BR>
   NB: in a sample BNC file I looked at, all occurrences of "like" were
    marked as prepositions,  although I would have classed them as
  adverbs.}

<BR> 
<BR> not unlike
<BR> not dissimilar

<BR>
<BR> look like, look as if/though 
<BR> look ((adjective)) {e.g., "looks tired" said of a piece of clothing}
   <UL>     {when these phrases are actually to do with visual appearance}
   </UL>
<BR>
? {so-and-so is a } ((noun)) face
<BR>
{insult about appearance being like that of ((noun));
e.g. frog face, poo face; but instead of "face" being considered a
signal we could claim that we just have an implicit copula metaphor/simile about
the face}
(added 29jan07)

<BR>
<BR> {suffix:} [-]like 
<BR> {suffixes:} [-]ish[ly], [-]y
<BR>    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
     {e.g.: a curry-ish meal; a glassy stare}
<BR>
{the hyphen may be important for "ish" and "y" because
otherwise we may pick up far too many non-metaphorical words}

<BR>
<BR> {suffix:} [-]ly <BR> {when it makes an ADJECTIVE, not an adverb;
e.g. "matronly"; but we'll need to avoid ordinary adjectives ending in
"ly", such as: likely, holy, wily.}

<BR> 
<BR> ?? {suffix:} [-]ily {when forming an adverb}

<BR> 
<BR> -style, -fashion
<BR>    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

<BR> [not] as ... as
<BR> not so ... as

<BR> 
<BR> as if/though
<BR> as it were


<BR>
<BR> ... thing, ... thingy, ... thingamajig {etc.}
{e.g., "this handle thing" referring to something is only like a handle
or metaphorically a handle}

<BR>
<BR> seem/appear to
<BR> seem like

Miscellaneous or As Yet Unclassified (Possible) Signals
</H4>

old {as in: she's an old cow, my dog's an old softy, this silly old
            pencil, silly old thing}

<BR>
big old {similarly, and probably more securely a signal} (added 29jan07)

<P>

fat {fat cow, fat load of rubbish, fat idiot, ...}
<BR>
big fat (added 29jan07)
<BR>
(NB: "[big] fat" may directly signal insults rather than metaphor, but many
insults are metaphorical; also "big" may signal the metaphoricity of "fat" - 29jan07)

<P>

((someone) is an ((X)) for ((doing Y)) {e.g.: you're an angel for doing that}

<P>
you are ((NP)) {because the NP is often an insult}, 
you ((NP)) {similarly and probably more so} (these added 29jan07)


<P>
The ((NP)) ./! {i.e. complete sentence. Often expresses an insult.}
