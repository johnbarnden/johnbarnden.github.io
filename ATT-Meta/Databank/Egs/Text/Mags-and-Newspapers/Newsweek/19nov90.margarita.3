IT SHOULD COME AS NO SURPRISE THAT YOU'LL SAVE MONEY EATING WHERE THE
LOCALS EAT.  Good and reasonably priced restaurants can be found in
department stores and the basements of office buildings.  At lunch,
ask for teishoku.  It means special of the day, and includes rice,
miso soup, salad, meat or fish, and dessert- all for around five
dollars.  Ramenya and sobaya (noodle shops) are perfect places for a
quick and tasty meal.

Title:  Is It Panic Time or Not?
Subheader:  THE REALITY- AND PSYCHOLOGY- OR RECESSION
By:  Rich Thomas in Washington

1st column	1st paragraph
Never in recent U.S. history has an economic downturn been so widely
advertised- and feared- before it even began.  Output may indeed be
slipping into reverse: even George Bush last week hinted as much.  But
the latest numbers still show business advancing.  Gross national
product rose in the third quarter, and so did industrial production.
The jobless rated marked time.  SO WHY HAS CONSUMER CONFIDENCE
SUDDENLY SUNK TO LEVELS SEEN ONLY IN THE DEPTHS OF HARSH RECESSIONS
(CHART)?  Are Americans overreacting?  Or are the government's numbers
not showing how bad things really are?

2nd paragraph
The answer is both.  ON THE PSYCHOLOGICAL FRONT, AMERICANS HAVE SWUNG
ABRUPTLY FROM THE HIGH OF PEACE AND PROSPERITY TO THE DREAD OF
RECESSION AND WAR.  On the statistical front, inflation, technological
change and the shifting demographics of the U.S. work force have
combined to make the economy look much stronger than it is.

3rd paragraph
The psychological part is simple.  In August Americans were still
enjoying an eighth straight year of growth and victory in the cold
war.  Then came the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.  The public, already
reading aout banking problems and a nationwide real-estate bust, saw
oil prices double from $20 to $40 a barrel.  President George Bush was
suddenly dispatching half the entire Army, Navy and Air Force to the
Middle East.  "WE'VE NEVER SEEN CONFIDENCE COLLAPSE THIS DEEP BEFORE
AN ACTUAL SLOWDOWN," SAYS JASON BRAM OF THE CONFERENCE BOARD, WHICH
TRACKS CONSUMER ATTITUDES.  "WE THINK THE WAR THREAT, AND MAYBE EVEN
THIS FALL'S LONG TAX BATTLE, HURT CONFIDENCE AS MUCH AS ECONOMIC
WEAKNESS."

2nd column	1st paragraph
Other depressants are also at work.  One is the specter of the Great
Depression.  THE COLLAPSE OF THE SAVINGS AND LOAN INDUSTRY AND NOW NEW
OF GIANT BANKING LOSSES FROM THE REAL-ESTATE CRUNCH "MAY POSSIBLY BE
RAISING FEARS," IN THE WORDS OF VICTOR ZARNOWITZ AT THE UNIVERSITY OF
CHICAGO, "OF A BANK CRASH LIKE THE ONE IN THE '30S, WHEN UNEMPLOYMENT
HIT 25 PERCENT."  This is highly unlikely; besides, deposits are now
insured.  BUT THE SHADOW OF HISTORY HAS PILED EXTRA ANXIETY ONTO
ALREADY EXAGGERATED FEARS ABOUT THE RECESSION.

3rd column	1st paragraph
The worst slowdown since World War II, in 1982, raised unemployment
from about 5 to 10.8 percent.  (Average recessions create a 7.5
percent jobless increase.)  Even then, only one person out of every 20
in the work force actually lost a job.  The other 29 were untouched.
In most downturns, "the overwhelming majority of persons go on doing
what they are doing and getting paid what they are paid," says Murray
Weidenbaum of Washington University in St. Louis.  "If inflation goes
down, as it usually does in recessions, the average person actually
comes out better off."  BUT THIS FACT IS GETTING DROWNED IN ANXIETY.
"THE SMALL CHANCE OF LOSING BIG THOUGH JOB LOSS IS FAR MORE
FRIGHTENING THAN THE HOPE OF GAINING A LITTLE FROM LOWER PRICES," SAWY
BRAM.  "IT'S JUST NO CONTEST."

3rd paragraph
The good news is that the labor-force slowdown will cushion the effect
of job loss throughout the coming slump.  BUT THAT'S SMALL COMFORT TO
THE THOUSANDS WHO HAVE ALREADY LOST THEIR JOBS- AND MANY MORE WHO
WORRY, RATIONALLY OR NOT, THAT THEY MIGHT BE NEXT.  As Weidenbaum
points out, "It's been a long time since we had [a recession], so
we're out of practice.  Overreacting is wrong, but it always happens.

Title:  Surprises From Uncle Sam
Subheader:  THE HIDDEN COSTS OF THE BUDGET WILL HIT MOST AMERICANS
	MORE THAN TAXES
By:  Jane Bryant Quinn

1st column	1st paragraph
IT'S NO SURPRISE THAT SO MANY CAPITAL HILL INCUMBENTS WON CHEERS FROM
THEIR CONSTITUENTS LAST WEEK.  After all the Sturm und Drang about
spending cuts and tax increases, the politicians blinked.  Cuts turned
out to be modest; some popular programs like child care got a big leg
up and no one laid a glove on the average voter's income tax return.
For most Americans tax rates won't change, nor will exemptions and
deductions.  Virtually all of the increases affect a tiny minority of
taxpayers- the 2.3 percent whose adjsted gross incomes stretch from
$100,000 up.

2nd column	3rd paragraph to the top of 3rd column
TAX ISSUES ASIDE, THE BUDGET DEAL IS FULL OF SURPRISES TOUCHING
PRACTICALLY EVERYONE:  
HOME BUYERS:  The price is going up for mortgages backed by the
Federal Housing Administration and the Department of Veterans' Affairs
(DVA).  For an FHA loan, you'll now have to pay (1) at least 43
percent of your closing costs in cash rather than borrowing all of the
money and (2) a higher insurance fee, if you're putting less than 10
percent down.  The VA will raise its upfront fee for all borrowers,
the exact amount depending on the size of your down payment.  The VA's
increase is supposed to last for only one year.  Both the FHA and VA
loan-guarantee funds have been running in the red.

3rd column	2nd paragraph to top of pg. 57
On the bright side, the DVA will finally be able to discover who's
really impoverished and who's lying.  BELIEVE IT OR NOT, OFFICIALS
THERE HAVE HAD NOT RIGHT TO DOUBLECHECK AN APPLICANT'S FULL INCOME.
With few exceptions, they've had to take his or her word- costing
taxpayers tens of millions in improper payments.  The new law broadens
the DVA's authority to require social-security numbers from anyone
applying for veteran's benefits.  Also, all claimants' incomes can now
be run against IRS tapes to see who really qualifies.  It's believed
that some vets on the rolls are actually dead.

Title:  Arms Race on Hill Street
Subheader:  POLICE WANT TO PACK SEMIAUTOMATIC WEAPONS- JUST AS SOME
	CROOKS DO
By:  Kevin Krajick

3rd column	3rd paragraph to top of pg. 59
The chance that an officer will ever use his or her gun- much less be
helped by extra ammo- is small.  James Fyfe, a firearms expert who is
a professor at American University, estimates the average big-city cop
is involved in a fatal shooting every 450 years; most, he says, never
fire their guns.  AND ALTHOUGH THE BAD GUYS HAVE FANCIER WEAPONS, THE
NUMBER OF POLICE MURDERED ON THE JOB (66 IN 1989) HAS DROPPED IN
RECENT YEARS, A FACT RESEARCHERS ATTRIBUTE TO BEEFED-UP OFFICER
TRAINING AND THE INCREASED USE OF BULLET-RESISTANT VESTS- NOT HEAVIER
WEAPONRY.

pg. 59		1st column	1st paragraph to top of 2nd column
Skill or surprise aremost often the deciding factors in a gunfight.
Experts say most confrontations take place at a range of five or 10
feet, involve just two or three shots and are over in a few seconds.
Says Maj. Jimmy Hall, chief of training for the Atlanta Police
Department:  "Most of our officers who have been killed never got off
a round.  If you have a pistol, it's there more for confidence than
anything."  Exactly, says Larry Lonis, chief of the Marceline, Mo.,
Police Department.  "I hope we never have to use them, but if we do,
we have them."  HIS SIX OFFICERS HAVE NOT FIRED A SHOT IN HIS MEMORY
BUT HAVE STARTED CARRYING SEMIAUTOMATICS AND 50 ROUNDS OF AMMO.

3rd column	1st paragraph
As for the ultimate firepower- fully automatic weapons- most police
departments keep a few, but allow SWAT teams to take them out only in
extraordinary situations.  The sole civilian agency routinely using
them is the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, which, faced with
heavily armed dealers, has issued all agents 9-mm Colt submachine guns
that fire 800 rounds a minute.  Some gunmakers say police sales are
growing as more departments develop tactical teams, but few predict
the U.S. cities will start resembling Europe or Latin America, where
machine-gun-toting cops are common.  "The minute we start looking like
an occupying army, we lose our public support," said Bud Meeks,
executive director of the National Sheriffs Association.  "YOU CAN'T
SET A GUY ON THE CORNER WITH AN M-16 AND EXPECT PEOPLE TO FEEL LIKE
HE'S PROTECTING THEM.  It's threatening."

Title:  Eavesdropping on Noriega
Subheader:  LEAKED TAPES MAY TORPEDO THE GOVERNMENT'S CASE
By:  Spencer Reiss in Miami

1st column	2nd paragraph
The controversy revolved around the undisputed fact that Noriega's
jailers at the Metropolitan Correctional Center outside Miami had been
taping his phone calls.  This is standard procedure at all federal
prisons, and it is intended to prevent inmates from using the phone to
plot escape attempts or hatch criminal conspiracies from behind bars.
THE LISTENERS AT MCC SOON DISCOVERED THAT NORIEGA WAS REPEATEDLY
CALLING SUPPORTERS IN PANAMA TO ORCHESTRATE OPPOSITION TO PRESIDENT
GUILLERMO ENDARA'S SHAKY GOVERNMENT.  THAT REVELATION, LEAKED BY U.S.
GOVERNMENT SOURCES, MADE HEADLINES LAST MONTH- BUT WHILE THE GENERAL'S
ATTEMPTS TO PLAY POLITICS MAY BE TROUBLESOME TO ENDARA, FEDERAL
OFFICIALS RELUCTANTLY DECIDED THAT INMATE NORIEGA HAD A PERFECT RIGHT,
UNDER U.S. LAW, TO CALL PANAMA ANY TIME HE LIKED.

Title:  Not In His Own Words
Subheader:  DR. KING PLAGIARIZED SOME EARLY WRITINGS
By:  Bill Turque with Nadine Joseph in Palo Alto and Patrick Rogers in
	New York

1st column	1st paragraph
As a college freshman, Clyborne Carson attended the 1963 March on
Washington, where the Rev. Martin Luther King delivered his now
legendary "I have a dream" speach.  The Stanford University
historian's first book was a study of black awakening in the '60s.
When Coretta Scott King asked him to edit and publish her husband's
papers in 1985, it was another distinction in a long career of study
and personal dedication to the struggle for civil rights.  "BUT
CARSON'S SCHOLARSHIP LED HIM TO A DISTURBING DISCOVERY, DETAILED LAST
WEEK IN THE WALL STREET JOURNAL:  EXTENSIVE PORTIONS OF KING'S
ACADEMIC WRITINGS, INCLUDING THE DISSERTATION FOR HIS 1955 DOCTORAL
DEGREE FROM BOSTON UNIVERISTY, HAD BEEN PLAGIARIZED.  "Martin Luther
King Jr. was a great man," says Carson, "but a careless scholar."

2nd column	1st paragraph to top of 3rd column
Historians are at a loss to explain King's dubious scholarship.  It
almost certainly was not out of a need to cover up academic
shortcomings.  King had been in colleges, universities and seminaries
for 11 years by the time he submitted his dissertation; he earned
strong grades at Crozer and BU, and even took a course in thesis
writing.  One dispiriting possibility:  his teachers held him to a
lower standard of performance because he was black.  Carson and those
who worked with King suggest he had taken the oral traditions of the
black church with him to academia.  IN "VOICE MERGING," PREACHERS
SYNTHESIZE THE WORDS AND IDEAS OF THOSE WHO SPOKE BEFORE THEM.  As
Joseph Lowery of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference told the
New York Times:  "Preachers have an old saying.  The first time they
use somebody elses's work they give credit.  The second time, they say
some thinker said it.  The third time they just say it."

3rd column	1st paragraph
The real question is whether Carson's findings diminish King's legacy-
the majestically articulated vision of racial justice for which he won
the 1964 Nobel Peace Prize.  The historic value of the early papers in
question is virtually nil.  They carry no hint of the galvanizing
message he would one day deliver extemporaneously from the pulpit.
SCHOLARS HAVE KNOWN FOR YEARS THAT KING'S LATER BOOKS AND MAGAZINE
ARTICLES WERE WRITTEN BY OTHERS.  But such is the case with numerous
public figures.  "It's the element of submitting it for academic
credit that makes the difference," King biographer DavidGarrow told
NEWSWEEK.  It will diminish his reputation."

IF YOU TRIED TO MAKE EVELYN CAMERON UP, NOBODY WOULD BELIEVE YOU.
This aristocratic Victorian Englishwoman (her half brother was Lord
Battersea, a big noise in Gladstone's cabinet) was an expert
equestrian, an avid hunger, a loving wife, a fine writer, an observant
naturalist, an accomplished rancher and, above all, a superb

3rd column	2nd paragraph
MORRIS AND JONES HAVE SOME IMPORTANT CONCERNS IN COMMON, ESPECIALLY
ISSUES OF SEXUAL POLITICS, BUT WHILE MORRIS'S WORK IS A STUDY IN
CONSCIENTIOUS IRONY, JONES MASTERFULLY LAYS BARE HIS HEART, HIS MIND
AND HIS VERY GUTS.  Morris is famous for his same-sex partnering;
Jones sails beyond to choreograph such unforgettable images as the one
that concludes a section based on Sojourner Truth's "Ain't I a woman?"
speech. The last person onstage is a tall, glamorous, black male
dancer who sashays briefly in a tight white miniskirt and white high
heels.  He doesn't look masculine, feminine, androgynous, gay or
straight; he doesn't even look like a paradoy.  He looks like sex,
only more so.

Title:  How the West Was Lost
Subheader:  THIS TIME THE GOOD GUYS WEAR WAR PAINT
By:  David Ansen

1st column	2nd paragraph to top of pg. 68
So it is no shock to see him, in Union soldier uniform, atop a horse
on the great plains of the American West.  The wide-open spaces have
always been a congenial home to Hollywood's reticent romantic figures:
the wilderness demands down-to-earth heroes, even as it leaves lots of
space for big dreamers.  DANCES WITH WOLVES, which Costner directed,
coproduced and stars in, is a sweeping, three-hour epic that mixes Old
Hollywood grandiosity with New Hollywood sensitivity.  As a filmmaker,
Costner reinforces the persona he's developed as a star.  LIKE THE
IDEALISTIC HERO OF "FIELD OF DREAMS," WHO FUSED COUNTERCULTURAL
SENTIMENTS WITH BUSH-ERA CONSERVATISM, COSTNER GIVES US AN AMBITIOUS
REVISIONIST READING OF THE FRONTIER WITHIN AN ESTHETICALLY
CONSERVATIVE FORM.  Redressing a century of Hollywood historical bias,
he presents the Wild West from the Native American point of view.
This time the Sioux Indians are the good guys, and almost every white
man in sight (our hero excepted) is a lout.  In a sense, he's merely
turned the old cliches inside out:  Costner's frontier remains a moral
landscape where only white hats and black hats are worn.  Only the
heads have changed.

pg. 68		1st column	1st paragraph
"Dances With Wolves" is vulnerable both to charges of sentimentality
and anachronism- the hero exhibits a sensibility at times dubiously
contemporary.  BUT IF ONE'S MIND SOMETIMES BALKS, ONE'S HEART EMBRACES
THE MOVIE'S FINE, WIDE-OPEN SPIRIT, ITS GENUINE RESPECT FOR A CULTURE
WE DESTROYED WITHOUT A SECOND THOUGHT.

4th paragraph
It's an engrossing tale, and Costner directs with the confidence of a
Hollywood veteran well aware that entertainment comes before
earnestness.  He has a showman's instinct for mixing violence, humor
and ormance, a painterly eye for epic landscapes and an almost
anthropological appreciation fo the Sioux people.  The large Native
American cast- Graham Greene as the wise Kicking Bird, Dunbar's first
ally; Rodney A. Grant as the more skeptical warrior Wind in His Hair,
and Floyd Red Crow Westerman as the old chief (all of whom speak in
the Lakota language)- create noble but believable human characters.
COSTNER IS NO LESS SHREWD SERVING HIMSELF UP:  LIKE ROBERT REDFORD, HE
UNDERSTANDS THAT UNDERSTATEMENT AND A TOUCH OF SELF-MOCKERY ENHANCE
HIS APPEAL.  Dunbar may be too good to be true to the period, but in
these cynical times it's nice to cheer for a soulful hero, a man who
realizes there's more to life than looking out for No. 1.  "Dances
With Wolves" has a true epic reach and a romantic generosity of spirit
that one is happy to succumb to.

Title:  Dial `P' for Psychotherapy
Subheader:  NOW, REACH OUT AND TOUCH-TONE YOUR PSYCHOLOGIST
By:  Emily Yoffe

1st column	1st paragraph
WHEN COMEDIAN RICHARD LEWIS MOVED TO LOS ANGELES FROM NEW YORK IN THE
MID-'70S, HE REALIZED THAT HE NEEDED PSYCHOLOGICAL HELP MORE THAN
EVER, SO HE CONTINUED HIS GROUP THERAPY BY PHONE.  "my group
conference-called me," he says.  "I knew it was time for a change when
I heard the therapist say to one of the women, 'weep closer to the
phone'."  Lewis eventually found an L.A. shrink, but now he's on the
road so much that he often ends up having telephonic therapy with her.

middle of 2nd paragraph
Because of tight schedules and time-zone differences, these patients
often find themselves having therapy from pay phones, hotel rooms or
their offices.  Therapists say continuing a relationship by phone can
help patients move away without feeling disconnected.  "I THINK
TELEPHONE THERAPY IS ONE OF THE MAJOR THERAPIES OF THE FUTURE," SAYS
DR. ELLEN MCGRATH, A PSYCHOLOGIST IN PRIVATE PRACTICE IN NEW YORK
CITY.  But both doctors and patients acknowledge that therapy changes
when it becomes a long-distance relationship.

4th paragraph to top of 2nd column
But reaching out does not always mean touching.  Therapists say they
miss the nuances of their patients' body language and facial
expression, and vice versa.  And participants say home therapy lends
itself to quick fixes than free association.  Dr. Thomas Nagy, a
psychologist at the Stanford University School of Medicine in Palo
Alto, Calif., moved from Chicago four years ago and found himself on
the phone with a group of patients who were not ready to face a new
therapist.  HE THOUGHT THAT THE SESSIONS BECAME MORE LIKE "SUPPORTIVE
DISCUSSIONS" THAN RIGOROUS THERAPY.  "There's nothing wrong with
that," he says, "but they were less interesting and exploratory.  They
didn't have the same forward movement."

2nd column	1st paragraph to top of 3rd column
Therapists'professional organizations do not have formal positions on
the subject, but spokesmen say the groups have no ethical objection to
properly handled phone therapy.  Still, some professionals have
qualms.  Classical analysis would be inapropriate over the phone, says
Richard Weiss, a psychiatrist and member of the New York
Psychoanalytic Society.  "WHEN YOU'RE DOING ANALYSIS YOU ARE
FOCUSING ON WHAT THE PATIENT IS EXPERIENCING MOMENT TO MOMENT," HE
SAYS.  "To do that on the phone is such a distortion of the
interpersonal atmosphere."  Dr. Weiss adds that the phone my
exacerbate certain psychological problems.  "Often therapy is dealing
with how a patient does or doesn't feel close to people.  Doing it
over the phone gives the patient a place to hide."

3rd column	1st paragraph
Says Dr. Nagy, who has researched the subject for the American
Psychological Association:  "The question for the therapist is:  are
you depriving a patient of a better quality of care in a face-to-face
setting with someone in the same city?"  HE CONFRONTED THE LIMITATIONS
OF HIS PHONE WORK WHEN HE DISCOVERED HE COULDN'T TELL A PATIENT HAD
BROKEN DOWN IN SOBS.  "This patient had a multiple-personality
disorder.  I HAD NO IDEA HE WAS CRYING UNTIL AN ALTERNATE
[PERSONALITY] CAME ON THE PHONE AND SAID, 'DOCTOR, DON'T YOU KNOW
TEARS ARE STREAMING DOWN HIS FACE?'"

2nd paragraph
COMFORT ZONE:  YET DESPITE THE DRAWBACKS OF HARDWARE AND DISTANCE, IT
IS SOOTHING TO KNOW THERE'S SOMEONE WHO CARES AT THE OTHER END OF THE
LINE.  ONE BICOASTAL ADVERTISING EXECUTIVE, WHO CONDUCTS MUCH OF HER
BUSINESS OVER THE PHONE, HAS FOUND HER FOUR YEARS OF PHONE THERAPY IN
SOME WAYS PREFERABLE TO BEING THERE.  When she calls her New York
therapist from her Los Angeles bedroom early in the morning, "I'm in
my robe, in a very comfortable therapeutic space having an intimate
conversation in an intimate setting.  I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT THERE WAS A
CERTAIN ARTIFICIALITY TO A THERAPIST AND A PATIENT SITTING IN TWO
CHAIRS FACING EACH OTHER."  AUSTIN, TEXAS, PSYCHOLOGIST MARY TEAGUE HS
HAD SO MANY PATIENTS MOVE AND STAY IN CONTACT OVER THE PHONE THAT SHE
JOKES, "SOMETIMES I THINK I COULD JUST TALK ON THE PHONE AND HAVE A
PRACTICE."

Title:  Attention, K mart Shoppers!
Subheader:  LIVE LIKE MARTHA STEWARD FOR A MERE $3 A MONTH
By:  Jerry Adler

1st column	1st paragraph
For all her countless fans who could never get too much of Martha
Stewart... well, now they can.  With the appearance this week of her
new magazine, martha Stewart Living, the most famous caterer ever to
come out of Westport, Conn., joins Malcolm Forbes, Ellery queen and a
handful of other luminaries so admired that their names alone can
command attention on the nation's newsstands.  There's Martha on the
cover, radiating suburban perfection from a wicker porch chair.  There
she is again, picking her Christmas tree, dyeing pumpkins, making
holly weraths, smiling demurely on her family's 1951 Christmas card- a
total of 10 appearances in 132 pages.  SHE HAS THUS ACHIEVED WHAT MANY
WOMEN WOULD CONSIDER THE WORLD'S GREATEST JOB:  EDITOR IN CHIEF OF HER
OWN MAGAZINE AND PERMANENT COVER GIRL.

2nd column	1st paragraph to top of 3rd column
Living extends Martha Stewart's efforts to proselytize among the
middle class, efforts that began, amid some ridicule, with her 1987
licensing deal with K mart.  The market for Martha Stewart Living, the
editor in chief says, is "everyone who buys my books, plus all the
people who would like to buy them and can't go out and spend $50 on
one."  She makes a point on how "accessible" her advice is, and she's
right, in the sense of "inexpensive."  ON THE OTHER HAND, ANYONE WHO
TOOK HER ADVICE AND BOUGHT AN OLD CHANDELIER AT A GARAGE SALE AND
ATTEMPTED TO RESTORE IT HERSELF, SAVING $6,000 OR SO IN THE PROCESS,
MIGHT CONCLUDE THAT IT WOULD BE EASIER TO START LIFE ALL OVER WITH A
RICH HUSBAND.  Time Warner Inc., which is publishing Martha Stewart
Living, will distribute 500,000 copies of the first issue nationwide,
at a cover price of $3.  THEY WILL STAY ON THE NEWSSTANDS FOR SIX
WEEKS; A SECOND TEST ISSUE IS PLANNED FOR MARCH, AFTER WHICH-
DEPENDING ON HOW WELL IT DOES- IT MAY BEGIN APPEARING REGULARLY,
PERHAPS AS A BIMONTHLY.

3rd column	middle of 1st paragraph
A reporter asked if she has a Manhattan pied-a-terre for those late

STARTLING AS IF ANDY WARHOL HAD CONFESSED HE HANDN'T BEEN INVITED
