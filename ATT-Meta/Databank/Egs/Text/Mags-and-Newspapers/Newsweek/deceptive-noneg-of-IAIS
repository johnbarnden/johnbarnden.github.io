The following example shows that the form

      <QUOTATION>, X thought

(as in: ``I'm stupid'', John thought)

isn't always to susceptible to a straightforward metaphorical interpretation as
X saying the quoted thing to h'self.

The example:

  ``The plan was not highly original,'' the Soviet military thought.

  [Newsweek, 20jan92 p.24, insert, left column]

It becomes clear in next para that the quoted sentence is from a translation of
a Soviet military report. Therefore the quotation is being used in the ordinary
way to quote from a document, not necessarily to convey speaking-to-oneself.
