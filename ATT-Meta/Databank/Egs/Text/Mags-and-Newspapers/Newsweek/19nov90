Title:  Cracking the Major

1st column	1st paragraph
NEWSWEEK HAS LEARNED THAT AN AMERICAN SPECIAL FORCES OFFICER, WHO TOLD
U.S. AUTHORITIES IN JANUARY HEKNEW OF SALVADORAN MILITARY PLANS TO
MURDER SIX JESUIT PRIESTS LAST NOVEMBER, WAS LATER PRESSURED BY FBI
AND STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIALS TO RECANT.  "He was grilled and grilled
until finally he cracked," says a Bush administration source.

2nd paragraph
Nine days later Buckland told FBI agents he'd been warned of the
attack 10 days before it happened.  HE ALSO SAID THAT PONCE KNEW OF
THE PLAN AND TRIED TO STOP IT.  BUCKLAND SAID HE DISMISSED THE THREAT
BECAUSE HE DIDN'T THINK THE SALVADORAN ARMY "WOULD DO SOMETHING THAT
FOOLISH."  On Jan. 13 the FBI briefed U.S. Embassy officials in San
Salvador about Buckland's report.  On Jan. 18 Buckland said he'd been
confused and his earlier statements were "not correct."

2nd column	1st paragraph
U.S. officials told NEWSWEEK that Buckland's original statement was
"100 percent accurate."  THE ADMINISTRATION "DIDN'T WANT THAT STORY TO
COME OUT," SOURCES SAID, BECAUSE IT "WASN'T PRODUCTIVE TO THE CONDUCT
OF THE WAR."  Buckland couldn't be reached for comment.  The State
Department denied pressuring Buckland to recant, and the FBI had no
comment.

The exercise will be conducted within range of the Silkworm antiship
missiles the Iraqis have positioned at the border against a possible
U.S. invasion.  U.S. OFFICIALS SAY THAT THE OPERATION IS NOT MEANT TO
PROVOKE A CONFLICT WITH IRAQ, BUT WASHINGTON WANTS "INTENTIONALLY TO
RAISE THE ANTE TO SHOW WE HAVE THE CAPABILITY AND WE'RE READY TO TAKE
IT RIGHT TO THEIR BORDER."  If the Iraqis attack, the sources say,
U.S. troops will respond with force to protect the Marine battalion.

SOUTH DAKOTA STATE SEN. JUDY OLSON THOUGHT SHE HAD A REAL COUP WHEN
SHE STARTED USING A HIGH-TECH AUTO-DIALING SYSTEM TO CONTACT VOTERS.
Too bad the system did not, as planned, shut down at 8:30 p.m.  It
continued to call people's homes all night- until one voter phoned
Olson at 3 a.m. for an explanation.  Olson won anyway.

1st column	1st paragraph
While many American companies have kept a high profile in South Africa
by franchising arrangements with local white businessmen, McDonald's
has been conspicuously absent.  That may change- to the benefit of
black South Africans.  JOHANNESBURG SOURCES SAY MCDONALD'S IS
CONSIDERING ENTERING THAT MARKET BY FRANCHISING BLACK ENTREPRENEURS
ONCE U.. ECONOMIC SANCTIONS ARE LIFTED.  A group of black South
Africans has visited McDonald's headquarters and says it received a 
"positive" response.  McDonald's didn't return calls.

Title:  Backlash?

2nd column
SOME LIBERAL SAUDIS ARE WORRIED THAT LAST WEEK'S WOMEN'S "DRIVE-IN" IN
RIYADH COULD TRIGGER A BACKLASH IN THE KINGDOM.  On Nov. 6, 40 Saudi
women piled into 15 cars and drove around for half an hour,
challenging the Saudi ban on driving licenses for women.  The drive-in
was primarily the result of frustration:  Saudi women generally must
rely on their husbands or chauffeurs to get around and that can be
quite an inconvenience.  WHILE THEY ARE GENERALLY SYMPATHETIC TO THE
CAUSE, MANY SAUDI WOMEN DOUBTED THAT SUCH ODD DEMONSTRATIONS ARE
REALLY THE BEST WAY TO CHANGE MEN'S MINDS.  SAID ONE WOMAN:  "MANY OF
US BELIEVE THAT IT IS BETTER TO WORK WITH THE SYSTEM THAN AGAINST IT."

Title:  Bad Roads

3rd column	1st paragraph
EVERYONE KNOWS THAT THE U.S. INFRASTRUCTURE IS CRUMBLING, BUT NOW WE'VE
BEEN TOLD HOW MUCH OF A DRAG IT WILL PUT ON THE ECONOMY.  Drawing on
Department of Transportation figures, a new report by organized labor
warns tat in the next four years the lost productivity resulting from
bad roads and bridges will cause a 3.2 percent drop in the gross
national product, an 8 percent increase in the consumer price index
and a 2.2 percent reduction in employment.  Nationally, 41 percent of
all bridges are deficient or obsolete.

By the time he was eight years old, Bobby J. Trimble was earning a
man's wages by pulling cotton in the hot fields of West Texas.  SCHOOL
WAS FOR RAINY DAYS.  "IF YOU ADDED IT ALL UP, I FIGURE I GOT ABOUT
FIVE YEARS OF SCHOOLING ALTOGETHER,"  SAYS TRIMBLE, NOW 60 AND AN OIL
AND GAS SCOUT IN MIDLAND, TEXAS.

2nd column	1st paragraph
Christmas in April relies upon contributions.  On his desk in the
warehouse, Trimble has a thank you note from a senior citizen with a
check for $10 (some of the ladies bake cakes and cook pots of beans
for the workers); the biggest contribution-$40,000- came from a local
foundation.  No state or federal funds are involved.  SAYS THE
STRAIGHT-SHOOTING TRIMBLE:  "WE WANT TO DO WHAT'S NEEDED WITHOUT
FILLING OUT A LOT OF PAPERS AND DEALING WITH SOME BUREAUCRACY."

Tell the truth.  You were surprised to see our name on this car, right?
Well, it's true-this sleek, sporty 2+2 is the new Hyundai Scoupe.

2nd paragraph to top of 2nd column
BUT DON'T THINK ITS BEAUTY IS ONLY SHEETMETAL DEEP.  Because the
Scoupe is just as much fun to drive as it is to be seen in.  WITH ITS
PERFORMANCE-ENGINEERED ENGINE, YOU MAY NEVER WANT TO TAKE YOUR
FAVORITE SHORTCUTS AGAIN.

2nd column	1st paragraph
IN FACT, YOU MAY NEVER WANT TO GET OUT OF YOUR NEW SCOUPLE LS ONCE YOU
GET IN.  And start enjoying its contoured sport buckets seats.  Power
windows and mirrors.  Power steering.  Four-speaker AM/FM stereo
cassette.  Even its available CD system.

2nd paragraph
And to make sure the fun goes on and on, every Scoupe comes with a
3-year/36,000-mile no-deductible bumper-to-bumper warranty.

3rd paragraph
So make sure you see the new Scoupe for yourself.  IT'LL CHANGE WHAT
YOU THINK ABOUT, WELL, YOU KNOW WHO.

pg. 9 		1st column	1st paragraph
He breezed in, threw his jammed daily planner on the table and shot
questions at me, watching my reactions as if it were a job interview.
He eyed how much I drank.  Then he breezed out to his next
appointment.  HE HAD GIVEN US 50 MINUTES TO SIZE EACH OTHER UP AND SEE
IF THERE WAS ANY CHANCE FOR ROMANCE.  His exit was so fast that as we
left he let the door slam back in my face.  It was an interesting slam.

2nd paragraph
He is "actively pursuing new ways for men and women to interact now
that old traditions no longer exist."  That's a real quote.  He really
did say that, when I asked him what he liked to do.  THIS WAS A MAN
WHO'D READ MS. MAGAZINE AND BELIEVED EVERY WORD OF IT.  He'd been
single for 16 years but had lived with a few women during that time.
He was off that evening for a ski weekend, meeting someone who was
paying her own way for the trip.

3rd paragraph
I too am from the Experimental Generation, but I couldn't even pay for
my own drink.  TO ME, FEMINISM HAS BACKFIRED AGAINST WOMEN.  In 1973,
I left what could have been a perfectly good marriage, taking with me
a child in diapers, a 10-year-old Plymouth and Volume 1, Number One of
Ms. Magazine.  I WAS CONVINCED I COULD MAKE IT ON MY OWN.  In the last
15 years my ex has married or lived with a succession of women.  As he
gets older, his women stay in their 20s.  Meanwhile, I've stayed
unattached.  He drives a BMW.  I ride buses.

4th paragraph
TODAY I SEE FEMINISM AS THE GREAT EXPERIMENT THAT FAILED, AND WOMEN IN
MY GENERATION, ITS PERPETRATORS, ARE THE CASUALTIES.  Many of us,
myself included, are saddled with raising children alone.  The
resulting poverty make us experts at cornmeal recipes and ways to find
free recreation on weekends.   

5th paragraph to top of 2nd column
THE MAIN MESSAGE OF FEMINISM WAS:  WOMAN, YOU DON'T NEED A MAN;
REMEMBER, THOSE OF YOU AROUND 40, THE PHRASE:  "A WOMAN WITHOUT A MAN
IS LIKE A FISH WITHOUT A BICYCLE?"  That joke circulated through
"consiousness raising" groups across the country in the '70s.  It was
a philosophy that made divorce and cohabitation casual and routine.

2nd column	1st paragraph
What's worse, we asked for it.  MANY WOMEN DECIDED:  YOU DON'T NEED A
FAMILY STRUCTURE TO RAISE YOUR CHILDREN.  We packed them off to
day-care centers where they could get their nurturing from
professionals.  THEN WE PUT ON OUR SUITS AND TIES, PAKCED OUR
BRIEFCASES AND TOOK OFF ON THIS GREAT EXPERIMENT, CONVINCED THAT THERE
WAS NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OURSELVES AND THE GUYS IN THE OTHER OFFICES.

4th paragraph
Women should get educations so they can be brainy in the way they
raise their children.  Women can start small businesses, do
consulting, write freelance out of the home.  BUT WOMEN DON'T BELONG
IN 12-HOUR-A-DAY EXECUTIVE OFFICE POSITIONS, AND I CAN'T FIGURE OUT
TODAY WHAT EVER MADE US THINK WE WOULD WANT TO BE THERE IN THE FIRST
PLACE.  As long as that biology is there, women can't compete equally
with men.  A ratio cannot be made using disproportionate parts.

Title:  America on the Precipice

1st column	1st paragraph
YOUR COVER STORY "THE CASE FOR AND AGAINST WAR" (SPECIAL REPORT, OCT.
29) TOUCHES A RAW NERVE IN MANY AMERICANS OLD ENOUGH TO REMEMBER THE
VIETNAM EXPERIENCE.  Can it be that America is again on the precipice
of blundering into another unnecessary, unpopular and bloody war
because a president overreacts and want to play world policeman?  Can
Bush believe that such a war could be waged without tearing this county
apart?  ONCE AGAIN WE ARE BEING ASKED TO BELIEVE THAT IT IS
FUNDAMENTALLY IN THE AMERICAN INTEREST TO WAGE A COSTLY WAR PURELY TO
MAINTAIN OUR SPHERE OF INFLUENE IN A DISTANT LAND.  But we are not
dependent on oil from Iraq or Kuwait, nd we would be fighting and
dying to help regimes whose principles are abhorrent to us.  How much
better off we would be if our leaders had had the wisdom to avoid the
Vietnam quagmire.  This time, at least, we have the benefit of
hindsight.
By:  Dolph Hauer		Jackson Heights, N.Y.

2nd paragraph
Why not "The Case for Peace" as opposed to "The Case Against War"?
THE REASONS YOU GIVE FOR OPPOSING WAR ARE ALL SOLID AND THOUGHTFUL,
BUT IT IS SURPRISING AND UPSETTING THAT "PEACE" IS ONLY MENTIONED FIVE
TIMES.  You state that "almost everyone agrees that a peaceful
settlement is preferable to an unpredictable war," which is certainly
true, but this in itself is an unsettling statement.  After all,
wouldn't a peaceful settlement be preferable to any war?  It is a sad
commentary on American society when people turn to peace only as a
second option.
By:  Terry Meyers		New York, N.Y.

2nd column	1st paragraph
Didn't we Americans learn anything from ourWorld War Ii experiences?
Did all those brave men and women die for nothing?  Your "Case Against
War" repeats all the old appeasement arguments- it's the wrong war in
the wrong place for the wrong reasons; it's too risky, costly and
would last too long; if we destroy a foreign leader we'll be sorry
later- as if the bloody tears frin 1934- 1945 never happened.  MY
GENERATION LEARNED- THE HARD WAY- A BITTER LESSON; APPEASEMENT QUICLY
LEADS TO DISASTER BECAUSE AGGRESSION FEEDS ON APPEASEMENT.  Next time
you print dangerous and misleading arguments, put a byline on your
article- such as Neville Chamberlain.
By:  Victor H. Laws		Salisbury, Md.

2nd paragraph to top of 3rd column
WHY IS IT THAT YOUR SOLEMN, THOUGHTFUL DISCUSSION OF THE CASES FOR AND
AGAINST WAR DID NOT ASK IF IT WOULD BE LEGAL?  A fair interpretation
of the U.N. Charter would make it illegal for the United States to
start a war.  Under 42, even the U.N. Security Council is not
authorized to use force unless it finds that sanctions cannot or have
not worked.  OVER THE LAST MONTHS, WE HAVE ACCEPTED THAT
INTERPRETATION BY AGREEING TO PURSUE OFFICIAL APPROVAL FOR SANCTIONS
AND LIMITED MILITARY ACTION.  Does your ommission mean that our little
1990 fling with international law is now over?

Title:  Old-Age Debate

3rd column	2nd paragraph
SAMUELSON'S ARTICLE BUILDS ON MISCONCEPTION AND MANIPULATION OF FACT
TO CREATE AN IMAGE OF AMERICA'S AGED CUSHIONED BY BENEFITS AND FANNED
BY POLITICAL FAVORITISM WHILE THE REST OF US FOOT THE TAX BILL.  THERE
ARE SEVERAL POINTS WHERE THE AUTHOR VEERS FROM THE TRUTH.  First,
Samuelson reports that the percentage of federal spending devoted to
programs for the elderly has increased sharply since 1965.  What he
fails to note is that the increase is due in part to the growth of the
65-plus age group from 9.5 to 12.7 percent of the population in that
period.  He also overlooks the fact that a significant portin of
increases in Medicare outlays are a result of skyrocketing costs, not
expanding benefits.
By:  Sen. John Heinz, Ranking Member
	Senate Special Committee on Aging	Washington, D.C.

3rd paragraph to top of pg. 17
My wife and I are both in our 80s.  We have paid a very modest income
tax since our retirement because no tax has been levied on our social
security income.  WE HAVE BOTH FELT FOR A LONG TIME THAT THE
SOCIL-SECURITY BENEFITS WE RECEIVE SHOULD BE TAXED.  It is unfair to
require current wage-earners who are below retirement age to assume so
much of the governmental expenses related to the elderly.  WE WANT TO
PAY OUR SHARE.
By:  Arthur W. Shively		Lancaster, Pa.

pg. 17 		1st column	2nd paragraph
Samuelson relies on misleading statistical averages and misassumptions
such as "the elderly are still seen- by virtue of age alone- as
'needy'."  He then criticized the deficit-summit negotiators for
failing to make a hit on social security in the name of debt
reduction, a neat trick since social security's independent trust
funds did not add a cent to that deficit.  WHAT SAMUELSONSON FAILS TO
RECOGNIZE IS THAT SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE HAVE DONE MUCH TO
KEEPOLDER AMERICANS FROM BECOMING NEEDY.  MOST FAMILIES KNOW THIS,
DEPEND UPON IT AND PLAN THEIR LIVES AROUND IUT.  TO SUGGEST THAT
SOCIAL SECURITY BE SUBJECTED TO HASTY DEFICIT-CUTTING ACTION IN THE
HEAT OF ILL-TEMPERED NEGOTIATIONS IS SHORTSIGHTED FOLLY.

I was appalled when I read "Can the Boys Be Saved?"  (EDUCATION, Oct.
15), on the Milwaukee school board's plan to create special schools
for black boys.  AS USUAL, PEOPLE FEEL THE NEED TO ISOLATE CHILDREN TO
TRY TO HELP THEM SUCCEED.  Did it occur to anyone that the reason
black males are "failing at epidemic rates" is because we try to label
them as special and different?  It is time to stop dividing our
children into categories and look upon them as equals in every sense
of he word.
By:  Kevin F. McElroy		Cape Girardeau, Mo.

4th paragraph to top of 3rd column
Who could resonably reject Milwaukee's plan?  It has been said that
this controversial experiement violates civil-rights laws and amounts
to officially sanctioned segregation.  HOWEVER, THE REAL ISSUE HERE
SHOULDN'T BE ABOUT SEPERATE BUT EQUAL SCHOOLS; RATHER, IT SHOULD BE
ABOUT WHETHER ORNOT WE WANT OUR BLACK POPULATION TO RECEIVE A BETTER
EDUCATION AND HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE THE MOST OF THEIR LIVES.
By:  Tammy Sue Leichtfuss	Winneconne, Wis.

3rd column	1st paragraph
Can the boys be saved?  I HOPE SO- BUT NOT AT THIS EXPENSE!  Your
chart shows that only 4 percent of all black men attend college, which
is extremely low.  But the number of black women attending college is
only 2 percentage points higher.  The emphasis that is being placed on
black male youths and on black male role models only sends out a message
to everyone- black children and women included- that the black male is
more important than his female siblings.

Title:  Will He Blink?
By:  Ev-An Thomas with Ann McDaniel, Thomas M. DeFrank and John Barry
	in Washington, Jeffrey Barthole in Baghdad and Margaret Garrard
	Warner with Secretary Baker

1st column 	2nd paragraph
The sounds from Baghdad betrayed high anxiety.  "If the fire of
aggression is unleashed against Iraq," blustered the government
newspaper al-Jumhuriya, "flames will cover everything...and will burn
in every direction."  LOGIC POINT TOWARD WAR:  UNTREASON SEEMED ABOUT
TO ENGULF THE FEEBLE MURMUR OF DIPLOMACY.

3rd paragraph
Despair is premature.  DESPITE ITS RHETORIC, THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION
WOULD BE WILLING TO ACCEPT WHAT SENIOR OFFICIALS CALL "A MESSY
COMPROMISE" ALLOWING SADDAM TO WIN SOMETHING AFTER WASHINGTON DECLARED
VICTORY.  "There would be no reward" for pushing the Mideast to the
brink of war, one senior official tolda NEWSWEEK but "Saddam does have
a face-saving way out should he choose it."  To be sure, he would have
to abandon Kuwait without preconditions.  But Washington wouldn't
object if he went with winks and nods from his Arab neighbors.  As
long as a decent interval elapsed, the United States would not
interfere with negotiations among what the official called the "happy
Arab family."  IF THESE FELLOW ARABS WANTED TO MEET SOME OF SADDAM'S
DEMANDS FOR A SECURE PORT ON THE PERSIAN GULF OR A SLICE OF A RICH
KUWAITI OILFIELD, THAT WOULD BE THEIR BUSINESS.

2nd column 	1st paragraph
The real question is whether Saddam would take such a deal.  "NO ONE
HAS COME BACK WITH ANY SENSE THAT SADDAM IS WEARING DOWN, CHANGING HIS
MIND," WORRIED A TOP BUSH AIDE.  THE WHITE HOUSE BELIEVES THAT SADDAM
WILL LEAVE KUWAIT ONLY IF HE UNDERSTANDS THAT WAR IS IMMINENT.  THE
BUILDUP IS THE "BAD COP" OF U.S. POLICY- MEANT TO CONVINCE THE IRAQI
STRONGMAN THAT THE ELEVENTH HOUR HAS ARRIVED.

3rd column	1st paragraph to top of pg. 23
IF HE REMAINS UNCONVINCED, THE CLOCK WILL STRIKE 12 NOT LONG AFTER THE
NEW YEAR.  THE BUILDUP ANNOUNCED LAST WEEK WILL TAKE MONTHS TO
ACHIEVE.  The Pentagon is adding three and one-third armored divisions
and some 1,110 tanks- to the two and one-third heavy divisions and 800
tanks the Army has already poised in the desert.  THE HOPE IS THAT A
MASSIVE AERIAL BOMBARDMENT WOULD ROUT IRAQI FORCES DUG IN AROUND
KUWAIT.  But no one expects air power to do the job alone.  American
ground forces will follow.  The Pentagon is no longer talking about
rotating troops home after six months.  The soldiers in the desert are
there for the duration.  BUT THEY CANNOT HANG ON INDEFINITELY, AND
ALREADY TIME AND WEATHER ARE WEARING DOWN MORALE AND EQUIPMENT.
Pentagon planners say that Bush will have to strike this winter, while
he has a maximum fresh force in the field- and before desert
sandstorms begin in spring.

pg. 23		1st column	1st paragraph
BAKER RETURNED LST WEEK HOPEFUL THAT MOST MEMBERS OF THE DISPARATE
COALITION SQUEEZING SADDAM WOULD ULTIMATELY BACK A MILITARY STRIKE.
WASHINGTON WOULD LIKE TO WIN A UNITED NATIONS RESOLUTION AUTHORIZING
SUCH ACTION TO USE A PSYCHOLOGICAL CLUB AGAINST SADDAM.  BUT SOME
ALLIES, NOTABLY THE SOVIETS, SEEMED TO WANT MORE TIME BEFORE TAKING A
STEP THAT COULD MAKE THE WAY TO WAR A LITTLE TOO CLEAR.

2nd paragraph
SUPPRESSED SMILE:  Among the five permanent members of the U.N.
Security Council-  The United States, Britain, France, the Soviet
Union, and China- the key is the Kremlin.  In Moscow last week
Secretary Baker had to suppress a smile when Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard Shevardnadze told reporters that the "use of force could not be
ruled out."  BAKER BELIEVES THE SOVIETS WILL EVENTUALLY SIGN ON TO A
U.N. RESOLUTION.  President Bush will try to knot the deal when he
meets Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev at a minisummit in Paris next
Sunday.

3rd paragraph
The Soviets are playing a careful game in the gulf, trying to please
both Washington and their old Arab clients (page 25).  THE KREMLIN
WOULD LIKE TO BE SEEN AS THE PEACEMAKER, AND TO THAT END, SOVIET ENVOY
YEVGENY PRIMAKOV HAS BEEN SHUTTLING BETWEEN MOSCOW, WASHINGTON AND
BAGHDAD.  IT WAS PRIMAKOV WHO IN EARLY OCTOBER FLOATED THE FIRST HING
OF COMPROMISE FROM SADDAM:  WITHDRAWL IN RETURN FOR THE RUMAILA
OILFIELD AND THE ISLANDS OF WARBA AND BUBIYAN AT THE HEAD OF THE GULF.
After some tough words from Bush, Primakov told Saddam at a meeting in
late October that he must abandon all of Kuwait first.  Saddam balked.
But Primakov saw a ray of hope.  "When I put it quite definitely to
him, 'If you don't withdraw, there will be a military strike against
you,' he showed he was in a position to do something," said Primakov.
The Soviet envoy did not elaborate on the "something," and Gorbachev
later told Baker he saw no encouraging signs from Saddam.

top of pg. 24		1st column	1st paragraph
At the moment, the Saudi and Kuwaiti royal families are unrelenting in
their hostility to Saddam Hussein.  BUT MANY SAUDIS- AND CERTAINLY
MANY EGYPTIANS ARE LEERY OF A WAR PITTING ARAB AGAINST ARAB.  THE
ADMINISTRATION HOPES THAT SADDAM'S ARAB FOES WOULD SETTLE FOR A POLICY
OF CONTAINING HIM WITHIN IRAQ.  Ideally, all American troops would go
home, but a tripwire Arab ground force backed by U.S. air and naval
forces and U.S. stockpiled equipment would remain to deter Iraqi
aggression.

2nd paragraph to top of 2nd column
THE UNITED STATES WILL WANT some restraints on Saddam's chemical- and
nuclear-war potential.  But any arms-control regime would raise an
awkward question:  would Israel have to abide by the same rules?  THE
ISRAELIS HAVE ALWAYS REFUSED TO GIVE UP THEIR NUCLEAR MONOPOLY IN THE
REGION.  Now that Saddam has the capacity to build a bomb- and other
wealthy Arab nations have the resources to buy one- THE UNITED STATES
HOPES THAT ISRAEL WILL ACCEPT SOME LIMITS ON NUCLEAR WEAPONS.  But
bringing Israel into the peace equation raises another sticky problem:
no regional security arrangement is possible unless Israel resolves
the Palestinian issue.

2nd column 	1st paragraph to top of 3rd column
Saddam might not trust his Arab brothers, much less Washington or Tel
Aviv, to honor a compromise.  He could well choose to fight.  Although
he has been warned by all sides that a war would be suicide, he is
said to doubt America's staying power.  FIGURING THAT THE AMERICAN
PUBLIC WOULD NOT STAND FOR A PROTRACTED WAR, HE MIGHT LET THE KILLING
BEGIN TO SEE WHO WOULD LAST THE LONGEST.  In its bloody war against
Iran, Iraq lasted eight years.  SUCH CALCULATION WOULD BE WRONG:  ONCE
THE BODY BAGS BEGAN COMING HOME, PRESIDENT BUSH WOULD HAVE TO ACHIEVE
VICTORY TO JUSTIFY THE COST.  BUT THEN MOST WARS ARE BORN OF
MISCALCULATION.

Title:  Still Searching for a Way to Avoid War
By:  Christopher Dickey in Amman

1st column	1st paragraph
Is Saddam Hussein looking for a peaceful way out of his standoff with
the West?  ONE MAN WHO THINKS SO IS KING HUSSEIN OF JORDAN, WHO MAY
UNDERSTAND THE IRAQI LEADER BETTER THAN MOST.  ALONE AMONG MIDEAST
LEADERS, THE KING TOOK SADDAM'S TALK OF A STRIKE ON KUWAIT SERIOUSLY
BEFORE THE INVASION.  HE KNEW SADDAM WASN'T THE KIND TO BLUFF.  Now
the king says, Saddam is searching for a way to avoid war.  "THERE'S A
VERY, VERY CLEAR WISH FOR A PEACEFUL SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM," THE
KING TOLD NEWSWEEK.

2nd paragraph
OR AT LEAST THAT IS WHAT HIS BEST INFORMATION- AND HIS INSTINCTS -TELL
HIM.  Burned by his initial efforts to act as a broker between the
West and Iraq, Hussein hasn't met with Saddam for about two months,
even as the Iraqi leader received a stream of envoys from Europe,
Japan and the Soviet Union.  BUT THROUGH CONTANT CONTACTS WITH IRAQI
OFFICIAL, THE JORDANIAN LEADER SAYS HE DETECTS A DEGREE OF FLEXIBILITY
THAT STILL IS NOT REFLECTED IN THE IRAQI GOVERNMENT'S OFFICIAL
PRONOUNCEMENTS.  "Given the opportunity," he says, the Iraqis would
pull out of most of Kuwait- though exactly how far they would withdraw
would have to be determined at "the Arab level."  SADDAM STILL WANTS
ACCESS TO THE GULF AND AGREEMENT WITH THE KUWAIT ON OIL AND AID.

2nd column	1st paragraph
BAGHDAD IS ALSO PLAYING DOWN ITS INSISTENCE ON "LINKAGE" BETWEEN A
PULLOUT FROM KUWAIT AND AN ISRAELI WITHDRAWAL FROM THE OCCUPIED
TERRITORIES.  INSTEAD, SAYS THE KING, SADDAM MIGHT SETTLE FOR A
GENERAL COMMITMENT BY THE WEST TO ADDRESS THE ARABS' LONG-FESTERING
GRIEVANCE OVER PALESTINE.

2nd paragraph
ON OTHER ISSUES, HOWEVER, SADDAM WANTS GAURANTEES.  Faced with the
burgeoning American and allied presence in the region, and President
Bush's talk of preparation for "offensive" actions, Saddam will ask
for a promise that if he does withdraw from Kuwait and release the
hostages, he will not be blockaded and attacked afterward.  Saddam is
willing to talk peace, not surrender.

3rd column	1st paragraph
In his more optimistic moments, King Hussein suggests negotiations
over Kuwait could eventually lead to more extensive talks.  HE
BELIEVES IRAQ IS WILLING TO NEGOTIATE THE REDUCTION OR ELIMINATION OF
ITS MOST FEARSOME ARSENALS AS PART OF AN EFFORT TO "REMOVE WEAPONS OF
MASS DESTRUCTION- BE THEY CHEMICAL, BACTERIOLOGICAL, NUCLEAR- FROM A
REGION THAT SPANS AN AREA FROM IRAN TO THE ATLANTIC, INCLUDING ISRAEL
AND IRAQ."

2nd paragraph to top of 4th column
SO FAR, THE KING DOESN'T SEE MUCH PROGRESS IN THE DIRECTION OF
NEGOTIATION.  HE SEEMS NOT TO KNOW OF ANY BACK-CHANNEL TALKS BETWEEN
WASHINGTON AND BAGHDAD, NOR OF ANY SIGNALS THAT MAY HAVE BEEN SENT VIA
ONE OF THE MANY EMISSARIES THAT HAVE PARADED TO BAGHDAD.  "What is
missing," he says, is the creation of "bridges for dialogue, bridges
for a resolution of this problem."

4th column	2nd paragraph
"That was an unfortunate statement," says the exasperated monarch,
blaming Baghdad's "minimal" contact with the outside for its "many
MISUNDERSTANDINGS OF THE MOOD OF THE WORLD, OF HOW TO APPROACH THE
WORLD."  THE BRITISH-EDUCATED KING SAYS HE IS TRYING TO EXPLAIN EACH
SIDE TO THE OTHER- "FIGHTING," AS HE PUTS IT, "TO KEEP HOPE ALIVE."
It is, to say the least, an uphill battle.

Subheader:  THE SOVIET UNION GAINS A FOOTHOLD IN THE GULF
By:  Russel Watson with Margaret Garrard Warner and Fred Coleman in
	Moscow
 
1st column	1st paragraph
There aren't many statesmen who have discussed the Persian Gulf Crisis
in depth with both George Bush and Saddam Hussein.  One who has,
Soviet envoy Yevgeny Primakov, has become a professional optimist.  "I
AM CONFIDENT THAT A PEACEFUL SOLUTION IS POSSIBLE," HE SAID LST WEEK
DURING A RECEPTIN IN THE KREMLIN.  SOVIET SOURCES CONCEDE THAT AFTER
TWO SESSIONS WITH THE UBIQUITOUS PRIMAKOV LAST MONTH, SADDAM SHOWS NO
SIGN OF ACTUAL MOVEMENT TOWARD A COMPROMISE.  Even so, the role of
peacemaker has paid off handsomely for Primakov and for the Kremlin.

2nd column	1st paragraph
Last week Secretary of State James Baker talked with Shevardnadze for
13 hours at President Mikhail Gorbachev's dacha outside Moscow.  THE
AMERICANS SAID GORBACHEV WAS DISMAYED BY PRIMAKOV'S LACK OF SUCCESS
WITH SADDAM.  ACCORDING TO SOVIET SOURCES, SADDAM WAS WILLING TO
CONSIDER A COMPROMISE SETTLEMENT, UNDER WHICH HE MIGHT ULTIMATELY
OBTAIN TWO KUWAITI ISLANDS AND CONTROL OVER A DISPUTED OILFIELD.  BUT
HE WAS NOT WILLING TO START THE PROCESS BY COMPLETELY WITHDRAWING HIS
FORCES FROM THE EMIRATE, AS DEMANDED BY THE INTERNATIONAL COALITION
ARRAYED AGAINST HIM.

2nd paragraph to top of 3rd column
AMERICAN OFFICIALS AND SOME SOVIET ANALYSTS BELIEVE GORBACHEV HAS
CONFLICTING OBJECTIVES.  HE WANTS A PARTNERSHIP WITH WASHINGTON, BUT
HE ALSO WANTS TO MAKE SURE THAT MOSCOW COMES OUT ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF
WHATEVER HAPPENS IN THE GULF.  Since the Crisis began, the Kremlin has
kept up relations with Baghdad, deciding to leave  thousands of
oilfield workers and at least 133 military specialists in Iraq until
their work contracts were completed.  Moscow also has agressively
courted other countries that can help it, economically or politically,
improving its relations with Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Israel.

column 3	1st paragraph
ARABIST OUTLOOK:  An academic specialist and former journalist in the
Middle East, Primakov, 61, is an influential member of Gorbachev's
Presidential Council.  As an Arabist, he represents a bureaucratic
mind-set at odds with that of Shevardnadze, for whom the U.S.-Soviet
relationship is of paramount importance.  "PRIMAKOV LOOKS AT SADDAM,
AND HE SEES A LONGSTANDING SOVIET RELATIONSHIP THAT HE WANTS TO
PRESERVE IF HE POSSIBLY CAN," SAYS ANDREI KORTUNOV, AN ANALYST AT
MOSCOW'S INSTITUTE FOR THE U.S.A. AND CANADA.  By allowing Primakov to
play a conspicuous role in the crisis, Gorbachev keeps his Arab
options open for as long as he can.

2nd paragraph
Some hard-liners charge that "Gorbachev and Shevardnadze are
continually yielding to the West without thinking through the Soviet
Union's long-term interests," Kortunov says.  GORBACHEV ALSO HAS TO
REMEMBER THAT IF HE SUPPORTS A MILITARY CRACKDOWN ON SADDAM, HE MAY
STIR UP NEW UNREST IN HIS OWN MUSLIM REPUBLICS.  Thus he has to keep
his distance from Washington, even if he agrees with U.S. policy.  The
payoff could be that, once the dust settles, Gorbachev's "good cop"
will be a lot more popular among the Arabs than Bush's tough enforcer.

They don't sell flowers out in the Sandpile.  So one day Pfc. John
Duggan, 24, a United States Marine who worked as a nightclub bouncer
before turning his attention to Saddam Hussein, picked some dry weeks
and mailed them to his fiancee.  "These are my roses," he wrote her.
AND HE SENT THEM WITH HIS LOVE.

2nd paragraph
In the Sandpile, it is always summer.  So as fall spread across
America, the father of Cmdr. Sue Carroll, a Navy nurse, cut some
autumn leaves and sent them to her in Saudi Arabia.  She hung them up
in her tent.  NOW, EACH TIME SHE LOOKS AT THEM, SHE SAYS, THEY REMIND
HER "THAT SOMEWHERE BACK THERE IS A PLACE WHERE THEY LEAD NORMAL
LIVES- AND LOVE ME."

3rd paragaph
In millions of letters home, soldiers are writing a foxhole chronicle
of America's showdown with Iraq.  Even though no one is shooting yet,
the mail is full of war stories:  the "Kiss 'em goodbye" alert
stateside, the barf-bag trip to the gulf, the heat, the flies, the
dead camels beyond the defense perimeter, scorpions big as field
mmice, sand vipers slithering through the dunes.  Each day you dig in
deeper, waiting for the balloon to go up.  AT NIGHT, BY FLASHLIGHT,
YOU PULL OUT YOUR BALLPOINT- AND WISH TO HELL YOU WERE HOME.

Tyrone M. Brooks, 19, of Detroit, Mich., died Oct. 30 in a boiler
accident aboard the USS Iwo Jima.  From a letter to his fiancee,
Juanita Smith:

2nd paragraph
I am jsut fine.  I miss you and the baby a lot.  I WISH I COULD BE
THERE TO HOLD BOTH YOU AND HER OR HIM.  Did I tell you we have gone
halfway around the world?  I talked to my division officer the other
day, and he said if we are back before you have the baby he will make
sure that I am home for the birth of our child.  YOU KNOW HOW HE KNOWS
I AM HAVING A CHILD IS THAT HE SAW YOU WHEN YOU CAME ABOARD THE SHIP.
Have you talked to my mother since the last time you wrote?  If not,
you better call her so she can know how her daughter-in-law and
grandbaby are doing.  If I am not home when you go into labor, call so
my brother can come to the hospital.  Have you picked out a baby bed
yet?  Are you going to have a baby shower so all your friends can buy
my baby all those nice gifts?  If you need the money to have one, just
tell me how much and when to send it.  WELL, I HAVE TO GO NOW BUT
REMEMBER I LOVE YOU AND THE BABY.  Write me back as soon as you get
this letter.  Let's see if we can keep a steady flow of mail to each
other.  That's all.  P.S. I will buy the baby what you pick out when I
get home.

Title:  To Sir, With Love

1st column	2nd paragraph
Right now we are living near an oasis.  There is a small deserted
village here and it's over 300 years old.  Camels, wild dogs and goats
come t drink water from the well and eat the dates that fall from the
trees.  EVEN THOUGH OUR SOLDIERS AND PILOTS, MEN AND WOMEN, TRAIN VERY
HARD TO GO TO WAR, ALL OF US HERE DON'T WANT THAT TO HAPPEN.  War is
not what you see at the movies; it's ugly and painful.  We're here to
protect other people [and] because this part of the world is very
important to our economy and businesses.  Hopefully, our actions will
make a difference.

bottom of pg. 28	1st column	1st paragraph
The grunts now on alert in the gulf are members of a volunteer army,
not draftees like those who served at the peak of the Vietnam War.
When orders were cut for the gulf, the first impulse of most of them
was gung ho.  "Remember this," Preston Coffer, 24, a Marine corporal,
wrote to friends in Texas.  "We are talking about Marines, not the Boy
Scouts.  WE ALL JOINED THE SERVICE KNOWING FULL WELL WHAT MIGHT BE
EXPECTED OF US."  And he signed off "Semper Fi."  Others felt similar
pangs.  Adrian Ingraham, 20, paratrooper in the 82nd Airborne, was the
youngest of three Ingraham sons ordered to the Middle East.  "Momma,
Daddy, we all have jobs to do," he wrote home.  He told them not to
ask the Army to reassign him if Oswald, 34, or Irwin, 22, is killed.
Then he headed out.  "If something should happen to me," he wrote, "my
will is in my wall locker at Fort Bragg.  Room 211.  I didn't have
time to send it home."

2nd column	1st paragraph
FEW EXPECTED TO FACE SUCH A DANGEROUS MISSION QUITE SO ABRUPTLY.  FOR
MARINE CPL. CRAIG ARMSTRONG, 22, THE REALITY SANK IN WHEN HE HAD TO FOLLOW
REGULATIONS AND SEND HIS WEDDING RING TO HIS NEXT OF KIN.  "If felt as
if my ring finger was naked," he wrote his wife, Christie.  "Every
time I try to feel it or look down and it's not there, I just think
about you."

3rd column	1st paragraph
Some troops flew, sitting on equipment crammed into transports, others
went by sea, packed like sardines.  NO MATTER HOW THEY GOT THERE, THEY
KNEW THE SANDPILE WAS WAITING THERE FOR THEM.  Cpl. Edward Gregoire,
19, a Marine who came from Hawaii, wrote to his parents saying, "Hey
the Persian Gulf sounds nasty, but it's beautiful, too.  Crystal clear
water.  Dolphins following the boat."  Returning from a flight, Gary
Porterfield, 28, an Air Force pilot wrote: "It's nothing but sand.
One big beach.  I CAN'T BELIEVE PEOPLE ACTUALLY LIVE HERE."  The place
had a way of bringing out the Omar Khayyam in the most prosaic grunt.
"You should see the night," Army Sp/4 Larry Campbell wrote his wife,
Barbar.  "The sky comes alive with a billion stars and a moon that
seems s bright as a spotlight.  It's like you can see the whole
galaxy."  

pg.29		1st column	3rd paragraph
The banter made everyone feel better in the early phases of the
military buildup; but as the psy-war in the gulf threated to become
the real thing, the mood changed.  David Martin, 19, of the 101
Airborne, wrote his sister Kelley that he and his buddy, Ray were the
two forward-most Americans at the front:  nothing but Saudis ahead of
them.  Mail arrived every three days, by truck and by chopper.  AS
TIME PASSED, DAVID TOLD KELLEY, HE BEGAN TO FEEL "A SENSE OF MOMENTUM
TOWARD A CLASH....LOTS OF MOVEMENT, LOTS OF EQUIPMENT."  He was an
easygoing guy- he wrote his letters on Garfield the Cat stationery
imprinted, "If life is a bridge to be crossed, let's dawdle all we
can" - but he confessed to his sister that he got "more and more
nervous every day."

4th paragraph to top of 2nd column
Others felt the same way.  Herbert Plummer, 21, a paratrooper, wrote
his mother to say that some nights he couldn't sleep "because of my
fear of this place."  HE DIDN'T KNOW WHY, BUT "BEEING IN THIS COUNTRY
MAKES ME SO JUMPY I CAN ALMOST FEEL AS IF SOMEONE IS WATCHING ME.  No
lie!"  At other outposts, dead camels beyond the defense perimeters
made the desert stink.  A fire incinerated one unit's mailroom.
Nerves tautened.  Even friends grew edgy.  Then, each evening just
after dark, Baghdad Betty, Saddam Hussein's answer to Tokyo Rose, got
on the radio to work on them.  "She tells us we're going to die and
Iraqi worms are going to eat us," Army Sgt. Eric Petersen reported to
his wife, Maryann.  "Pretty awful, huh?"

3rd column	1st paragraph
Coming off a routine watch on day, Michael N. (Chip) Manns, Jr., 23, a
machinist's mate third class aboard the USS Iwo Jima, wrote his father
about te frustrations aboard a ship jammed with sailors:  "men in my
workspace, men in the chowline, men in the showers, men all around
when I'm sleeping, men, men, men."  He told his mother he stood eight
hours of watch a day, worked eight, then slept four to six hours each
night in the jammed quarters.  "Everything is pretty routine," he
wrote.  "Actually, being over here doesn't bother me that much.  It's
just the waiting.  IF WE ARE GOING TO WAR, I WISH WE COULD GET THE
SHOW ON THE ROAD."  Two weeks later a steam pipe on the Iwo Jima
ruptured.  The blast killed Chip Manns.

2nd paragraph to bottom of pg. 30
Somewhere south of Kuwait, the Third Battalion of the 11th Marines is
dug into desert trenches, its 155-mm howitzers ready to deliver
supporting fire for a tank assault or amphibious invasion.  At sunup,
Marines crowd around the tailgate of a truck for mail call.  In the
heat and dust of the outpost, letters become tattered and stained.
Capt. Jerry Sneed carries in his pocket a creased sheet from his son.
It has a drawing of the Marine Corps War Memorial- the flag raising on
Iwo Jima- and the words "To Dad.  You make me proud Dad.  Jeremy."
OFF TO THE SIDE, PFC. JOHN DUGGAN HOPES FOR WORD FROM HIS FIANCEE
KATHRYN REDMAN.  They were engaged three days before he was sent to
Saudi Arabia.  "I'M IN LOVE, I CAN'T THINK ABOUT ANYTHING ELSE," HE
SAYS.  "I FEEL TOTALLY EMPTY.  I live in a hole in the ground and the
only thing that helps me to pass the time is her letters," he says.
He writes her constantly.  One time he pulled some hair off his chest
and sent it to her.  She sent him back a strand of her hair.  Then he
sent her those desert weeds and an impassioned audiotape.  "It was
like he was right here," she says.  "At the end of the tape I was
hugging the speaker next to me."

bottom of pg. 30	2nd column	1st paragraph
About 85 percent of Major Vaughn's letters and packages are addressed
to individuals.  He gives those marked "To any service personnel" to
people who get nothing from home.  It is not uncommon to find a
battle-hardened Viet vet like Massengill carrying on earnest
correspondence with 7- and 8-year-old kids and dusty grunts laughing
over lines from tiny pen pals like "If you guys can't end it, then my
Dad might have to come."  Kids not much younger than Pfc. Hosi
Johnson, 19, of the 101st Airborne, who was in high school in Chicago
only a year ago write to ask if he feels scared.  HE TELLS THEM, "YES,
IT'S ALWAYS AT THE BACK OF MY MIND.  I TOLD ONE KID THAT I JOINED THE
ARMY TO PAY MY WAY THROUGH SCHOOL AND I SAID IMIGHT NOT MAKE IT
THROUGH- BUT I TELL THEM I LIVE IN HOPE."

3rd column	1st paragraph
Mail alone cannot neutralize the Vietnam syndrome, but it helps.
Marine Staff Sgt. William Fitgerald, 30, was too young for Vietnam.
When he joined the corps 11 years ago, he heard Viet vets telling
horror stories all the time.  "They'd get letters from home, sure," he
says.  "But the media, the war protesters, even some of the
politicians were telling them they were doing the wrong thing, they
were murderers, they were on their own."  Now he gets letters from a
nun in Philadelphia who had eight brothers in World War II.  "SHE TOLD
ME SHE WAS PROUD OF WHAT WE WERE DOING, AND CARED FOR US AND- WITH A
NAME LIKE FITGERALD, TO SAY A ROSARY IF I WAS CATHOLIC."  He heard his
son say "Papa" for the first time when his wife, Carole, sent him an
audiotape.  Determined that the American soldier won't be forgotten
this time, she has distributed 2,000 aluminum bracelets marked "1990-
"Til our Fighting Forces Return."  SHE HAS ALSO WRITTEN TO PRESIDENT
BUSH, SAYING, "WE WANT PEOPLE TO REMEMBER WHEN THEY START COMPLAINING
ABOUT THE PRICE OF GAS TO THINK OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE PUTTING THEIR
LIVES ON THE LINE."

2nd paragraph
THAT INCLUDES WOMEN, WHO SHARE THE ALTERNATING CURRENTS OF BOREDOM AND
PAIN THAT NOW COURSE THROUGH DAILY LIFE IN THE GULF.  At the U.S.
Navy's Fleet Hospital Five in Jubail, where tents with 500 beds,
intensive care and X-ray units are pitched ready for casualties, Lt.
Carla Tolbert says, "Life gets strange here- something like a prison,
something like a girl's school."  

pg. 32		1st column	1st paragraph
The mail is a bridge, however rickety, between duty and love.  Out on
the line, Marine Lance Cpl. Frank Gudmundson, 22, a fire team leader
whoo will see sharp fighting if war breaks out, logs his letters and
thoughts in a journal.  He has entitled his little notebook "Total
(1990) Recall."  "My mind and my heart belong at home with my wife,
but my ass belongs to the Marine Corps," he writes in one passage.
The next sentence is "I will stand by patiently for mail call."  When
his mother sent a photo of him and his brothers as little kids, he
wrote in his diary, "It seems like yesterday we were out playing army
with our plastic machine guns, building bunkers out of hay bales and
counting to fifty when we had gotten shot.  Now it's the real thing
today.  AND I DON'T THINK COUNTING TO FIFTY WILL BRING US BACK ALIVE."

3rd paragraph
Something about these letters in the sand subverts the conventional
wisdom about what is at risk in the gulf.  Presidents and kings,
diplomats and generals speak the language of geopolitics and global
economics.  To them, the flow of oil is more important than the flow
of mail.  After listening to so much martial rhetoric from the top, it
is a relief to read things like, "Hello, Devil Dog Family," the
salutaton of a dusty Marine.  You worry about what could happen to
these pen pals if war does come, and very little that the top dogs
have to say helps much.  "I WISH I COULD HELP," WRITES SALOME
WELLIVER, A FOURTH GRADER FROM KANSAS CITY.  "But I'm just a
nine-year-old.  I pray for you and peace.  If war starts you can win.
God bless you."  Every one of you.

3rd column	1st paragraph
This fall, Fort Campbell is nearly empty.  By last week, 19,000
soldiers- the entire division plus support units- had shipped out to
Saudi Arabia, part of America's largest military deployment since
Vietnam.  In August and September, Ferguson and her husband sat in
their backyard, listening to "a constant soft roar of the planes," she
says.  "It never stopped.  EACH ONE WOULD TAKE OFF AND YOU WOULD
WONDER WHO WAS ON IT.  They'd take off, make that turn for the east
they'd be gone."

3rd paragraph to top of page 33
A few children waved goodbye to both parents.  Col. Ted Purdom left on
Sept. 24.  Amonth later, his wife, Lt. Col. Jean Purdom, shipped out.
Jean's mother Frances McKenna, came from Massachusetts to look after
grandsons Matthew, 11, and T.J., 9.  They save their parent's letters.
In one, dated Oct. 24, Ted Purdom wrote:  "Matt, I think of you each
day and I wear your acolyte cross all the time.  I JUST LOVE IT AND
KNOW IT PROTECTS ME."  ALTHOUGH THE ARMY HAS PUT NO TIME LIMITS ON
TOURS OF DUTY, T.J. BELIEVES HIS PARENTS WILL BE AWAY FOR SIX MONTHS:
"FIVE MORE MONTHS FOR MY MOM AND FOUR MORE MONTHS FOR MY DAD."  When
they return, "Me and Dad are going to go hunting and fishing.  My mom,
I'm going to save up money to buy her something.  Maybe a hair dryer."

top of pg. 33		1st column	1st paragraph
YEARS AGO THE ARMY DIDN'T WORRY TOO MUCH ABOUT THE PROBLEMS OF SPOUSES
AND CHILDREN ON THE HOME FRONT.  THERE'S AN OLD SAYING:  IF THE ARMY
WANTED YOU TO HAVE A WIFE, IT WOULD HAVE ISSUED YOU ONE.  That
attitude is a luxury the all-volunteer Army can no longer afford.
Attracting career soldiers means provodomg for their families as well.
At Fort Campbell, there are seven schools for 4,000 students from the
elementary grades through high school, a childcare center, financial
and emotional counseling services- even a woodworking class to teach
wives how to make home repairs while their husbands are away.

2nd column	1st paragraph
HANDLING THESE FAMILLY TENSIONS REQUIRES SOME INGENUITY.  Carolyn
Dove, principal of the Wassom Middle School, received a particularly
heartbreaking letter from a single parent, Staff Sgt. Leila Jordan,
who was distraught because she had not heard from her children,
Christopher, 13, and Daniel, 3.  Jordan signed the letter:  "Parent
always.  Even so far away."  The children were healthy (an aunt was
looking after them); the problem was unreliable mail service in the
early days.  BUT DOVE, MOVED BY THE LETTER, DECIDED TO MAKE SURE
JORDAN AND HER CHILDREN KEPT IN TOUCH.  Twice a week, Christopher
comes to her office and, under her supervision, writes to his mother.

3rd column	3rd paragraph
UNDER STRESS:  And always, there is the fear of hearing the worst
possible news.  The Army has procedures for notifying next of kin
(NOK, military parlance).  but under stress, it's easy to panic.  LAST
WEEK, ONE FORT CAMPBELL WIFE, VISITING RELATIVES IN ILLINOIS, RECEIVED
WHAT SHE THOUGHT WAS OFFICIAL WORD THAT HER HUSBAND HAD BEEN SHOT AND
WAS ON HIS WAY TO WALTER REED ARMY HOSPITAL IN WASHINGTON, D.C.  She
immediately flew to Washington, but no one at the hospital had any
information about her husband.  Finally, Army officials in Kentucky
checked with the troops in Saudi Arabia.  Her husband was fine; the
call had been a sick joke by an unknown prankster.

4th paragraph
AS THE WEEKS PASS, MOST OF THE FAMILIES HAVE TRIED TO ESTABLISH A
ROUTINE THAT BLOCKS OUT THOUGHTS OF THE DESERT.  But it isn't easy.
With the threat of war so close, even routine occasions take on added
significance.  Last week the students at Mahaffey Middle School made
patriotism the theme of their fall concert.  Most of the students wore
red, white and blue clothes to school.  The few that didn't had T
shirts or sweat shirts with special messages.  One girl's read:
"Someone in Saudi Arabia loves me."  Any one of them could have worn
it; virtually all have at least one parent in the gulf.  The concert
concluded with "America the Beautiful" -all three verses.  The
school's slide projector flashed the lyrics on a screen so the
audience could sing along.  But in this crowd, there was no need.
Everyone already knew the words.

Bottom of pg. 33	1st column	1st paragraph
Marine Cpl. Craig Armstrong of Carthage. N.C. drew gulf duty while on

Cris:

2nd paragraph
So how are you doing with all this Saudi Arabia s--- that is in the
papers and on the news every day?  DON'T BELIEVE HALF OF THE THINGS
THEY SAY.  Because it is opinions and speculation.  It's just a bunch
of politicians that don't know what they are talking about.  So don't
even worry about it.

3rd paragraph
We really have not been doing much.  We have got a new little game we
play now.  We wear our gas masks everywhere we go.  So someone can
simulate a gas attack.  And we will wear them until the CO says "all
clear."  I'm just waiting to see what games we will play next.

4th paragraph
I've started to notice that everybody in the platoon is [getting]
tighter with each other.  Most of them are starting to get the point
that this is serious, and not just another Panama invasion.  Where we
are heading now is for real.

5th paragraph
I told you on the phone that you would be receiving my wedding ring
[pursuant to Marine Corps instructions to leave valuables with
family].  I sent it yesterday.  It felt real weird not having it on.
It felt as if my ring finger was naked.  I just think about you and
coming home.  The first thing you will do is slide my wedding band
back on my finger.

Subheader:  BOTH PARTIES DECLARED VICTORY- AND THEN PORED OVER THE
	ELECTION RESULTS TO SEE WHAT WENT WRONG 
By:  Eloise Salholz with Eleanor Clift, Ann McDaniel and Thomas M.
	DeFrank in Washington, Lucille Beachy in New York, Andrew Murr
	in Los Angeles, Howard Manly in Atlanta and bureau reports

1st column	2nd paragraph
IN TRUTH, THE RESULTS WERE SO MIED THAT BOTH PARTIES HAD REASON TO
WORRY.  Despite predictions of an insurgency at the polls, voters
returned 96 percent of congressional incumbents seeking re-election.
But they gave a number of key figures unexpectedly slim margins:
popular two-term Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey nearly lost to an
unknown challenger, and Minority Whip Newt Gingrich almost found
himself on a midnight train to Georgie- without a job.  The Democrats
cemented their hold over Congress with a probable gain of eight House
seats- not enough to override a presidential veto but more than enough
to make the White House squirm- and solidified their place in the sun,
taking the Florida and Texas statehouses.  But the GOP won the big
one- California- and made serious inroads throughout the rust belt.
Overall, the Democrats will be well situated to expand their
congressional majorities when state legislatures begin redistricting
next year.

3rd paragraph to top of 2nd column
NO ONE FELT GREATER PRESSURE TO DRAW LESSONS FROM THE RESULTS THAN
BUSH, SINCE THE VOTE WAS CLEARLY A REFERENDUM ON HIM, TOO.  Two days
after the elections, he invited several of his closest outside
advisers to an East Wing lunch.  His first question:  "Where can I
improve?"  (ANYONE WHO THOUGHT THE ANSWER WAS TO FIRE JOHN SUNUNU HELD
HIS TONGUE SINCE THE CHIEF OF STAFF WAS ALSO PRESENT.)  Bush also
announced a new no-tax pledge, saying that next time Democrats would
have to raise income tax rates "over my dead veto."  Congressmen, too,
will probably take last week's close calls as a mandate for cowardice:
running scared, they are less likely than ever to step out in front of
difficult issues, or to reform a process that protects their seats.
But there are risks in playing safe.  "AMERICANS ARE VERY ANGRY AND
CYNICAL ABOUT THE SYSTEM," SAYS GOP POLLSTER RICHARD WIRTHLIN.  "They
think government is simply not governing."

pg. 35		2nd column	2nd paragraph
PHONE HOME:  Like nagging moms, voters in several states nudged their
wayward sons to visit more often and stop being such big shots.  New
York Gov. Mario Cuomo, who won a less than convincing victory against
a field of nobodies, may have some fence mending ahead of him.  ""We
didn't get that exulant shout that we wanted to hear from the people,"
he admitted afterward.  Bradley, who ran celebritylike ads and
wouldn't deign to discuss taxes, fervently promised the people to
serve out his hardwon third term.  AND CONSERVATIVE GOP FIREBRAND NEWT
GINGRICH, WHO OBVIOUSLY FORGOT THOMAS P. (TIP) O'NEILL'S AXIOM THAT
"ALL POLITICS ARE LOCAL," ALSO FOUND THE NATIVES RESTLESS.  "People
here want a nice Georgia congressman who will care about their sewer,"
says Kate Head, campaign manager for challenger David Worley, who has
demanded a recount.  By contrast, Democrats Lawton Chiles, who won
Florida's gubernatorial race, and Paul Wellstone, Minnesota's new
senator, ran highly effective grass-roots campaigns.

bottom of pg. 36	2nd column	1st paragraph
All the same, Cuomo remains the darling of the pundit class.  The
latest guess is that the %million left over from his gubernatorial war
chest is evidence that he's running.  THIS, OF COURSE, ASSUMES ANOTHER
BIT OF CONVENTIONAL THINKING- THAT BIG MONEY IS ESSENTIAL.  In 1990,
anyway, that wasn't always the case.  Bradley's opponent, Christine
Whitman, was outspent 12 to 1.  Ann Richards in Texas and Lawton
Chiles in Florida lost the fund-raising race but won anyway.  Beyond a
certain level necessary for maintaining a presence on the air, money
is mostly a way for reporters and other insiders to keep score.

3rd column	1st paragraph
LONG SHOTS:  If so, the politicians are fighting the last war.  It's
always senseless to sell long shots short, but besides Nebrska Gov.
Bob Kerrey, that's exactly what's happening.  Names like Florida Sen.
Bob Graham and Colorado Sen. Tim Wirth haven't even been floated, and
it's not so early anymore.  OF COURSE WITH SO MUCH OF THE PENT-UP
DEMAND FOR REFORM THWARTED THIS YEAR, 1992 COULD BE THE YEAR WHEN A
REAL OUTSIDER STORMS UP THE BARRICADES.  Who?  Think Colin Powell (who
won't reveal his party ID), Ralph Nader, Ted Turner, ex-drug-czar
William Bennettt (yes, a Democrat).  If they're unbearable, think some
more.

	GET WORSE
By:  Kevin Phillips

2nd column	2nd paragraph to top of 3rd column
Takeover prospets in the Senate are not much better.  A year ago
Republicans took their blueprint seriously enough to enlist five
popular Republican representatives to tackle "vulnerable" Democratice
senators in 1990.  All five were sacrificed in vain; not a single
Democrative Senate incumbent fell.  The sole candidate to beat an
incumbent, Minnesota's Wellstone, campaigned for taxing the wealthy-
and had been arrested several years ago at a bank sit-in protesting
farm foreclosures.  NOBODY HAD THOUGHT HE HAD A CHANCE.

3rd column	1st paragraph
FEW BIG-NAME DEMOCRATS, IN FACT, HAD WANTED TO MAKE 1990 SENATE RACES
IN WHAT SUPPOSED TO BE A STRONG ECONOMY AND A GOOD GOP YEAR.
Potentially strong contenders in Virginia, Indiana, Idaho, and Oregon
sat out races several could have won.  BUT EVEN SO, BY PICKING UP ON
ONE SEAT, THE DEMOCRATS EFFECTIVELY BLOCKED ANY REPUBLICAN HOPES FOR
1992, WHEN THEY'D NEED SEVEN SEATS FOR A MAJORITY.

pg.41		1st column	1st paragraph
IF THIS ALONE WEREN'T ENOUGH TO FRIGHTEN BUSH'S RE-ELECTION
STRATEGISTS, THERE'S ALSO GROWING SPECULATION THAT FINANCIAL PRESSURE
(RANGING FROM TUMBLING REAL-ESTATE VALUES TO DANGEROUS CORPORATE-DEBT
LOADS AND SPREADING BANK INSOLVENCIES) COULD MAKE THE 1991 DOWNTURN
FEED ON ITSELF, DEEPENDING INTO SEVERE RECESSION.  DEMOCRATS HAVE
ALREADY FOUND THAT ATTACKING BUSH AND THE REPUBLICANS FOR FAVORING THE
RICH IS A POTENT POLITICAL WEAPON.  But it has also been my thesis
that the 1980s, like the Roaring Twenties and the late-19th-century
Gilded Age, represented a once-a-generation bubble of debt and
speculation with the unnerving potential too implode and trigger a
populist reaction.  Some of that implosion-and-populist-reaction is
underway.  Will it intensify?  That is an all-important question, to
be answered over the next year or so.

2nd paragraph
MOREOVER, THE REPUBLICANS HAVE REASON TO WORRY THAT PRESIDENT BUSH
WILL HAVE TO CONFRONT ACCELERATING DOMESTIC AND INTERNATINAL PROBLEMS
AT A TIME WHEN HE HAS DEPLETED PRESTIGE AND LITTLE CONGRESSIONAL CLOUT
(LIKE THAT WHICH HOBBLED JIMMY CARTER IN 1979-80).  Since Election
Day, Republicans and Democrats in Congress, already self-centered and
unrly, have also become scared and fearful- scared by 1990s voter
surliness, fearful that grass-roots retribution could escalate in 1992
when many representatives will be running in partly new and unfamiliar
(and potentiall unfriendly) districts.  Anarchy is too strong a term,
but legislators' parochialism and self-entrenchment are sure to
deepen.  Cooperating with the White House is not likely to be a
heartfelt priority.

3rd column	1st paragraph		middle
It's the old schism- Main Street versus Wall Street, Peoria versus
Palm Beach.  Other cleavages are culgural, with largely Jewish
"neoconservatives" squaring off against fundamentalist-tinged
Christian "paleo-conservatives."  And international questions have
widened two more splits:  one between economic nationalists and free
traders and another between neo-isolationists and global
interventionists.  IF, AS MANY NOW EXPECT, THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION
MOVES TO ATTACK IRAQ, ANY NUMBER OF POLITICAL SCENARIOS COULD DEVELOP.
The American public will probably support a war- at first.  but if the
economy continues to worsen, producing what could be the 20th
century's first wartime recession even as body bags start coing home
to Dover Air Force Base, the politics could sour, too.

3rd column	2nd paragraph
All in all, George Bush could well be the last president of the
Republican White House cycle that began 22 years ago with Richard
Nixon.  And this raises a caution.  Final presidents of party cycles
are especially prone to be remembered for failure- Herbert Hoover for
the Great Crash, Lyndon Johnson for Vietnam and urban riots.  SO WHILE
ONE CONSERVATIVE CRITIC RECENTLY SUGGESTED THAT BUSH COULD BE GERALD
FORD AND JIMMY CARTER ROLLED INTO ONE, THERE'S AN EVEN MORE DISTRUBING
ANALOGY TO CONTEMPLATE- THE CHANCE THAT HE COULD COMBINE HERBERT
HOOVER'S ECONOMICS AND LYNDON JOHNSON'S MILITARY MISJUDGMENT.  It's no
more than a one-in-10 prospect, but perhaps even noting it can help
keep it from becoming a fact.

	Philadelphia and Mark Miller in Washington

1st column	1st paragraph
With no local economic turnaround expected before mid-1992, Mayor
David Dinkins faces an agonizing round of belt tightening.  It won't
be easy.  The city has added 50,000 employees to the payroll since
1983.  Many were added to meet pressing needs in the city's schools,
jails and social-service agencies; BUT FEW EXPERTS BELIEVE THE CITY IS
FUNCTIONALLY EFFICIENTLY- OR LOGICALLY.  In five days last month,
Dinkins awarded city teachers a 5.5 percent raise, announced plans to
hire 6,000 new cops- and then said 15,000 layoffs might be needed.
Dinkins's flip-flops "give the impression no one's at the whell," says
James Hughes, a professor of urban planning at Rutgers University.

2nd paragraph
PINK-SLIP-PROOF:  In Washington, which faces a $200 million budget
deficit, the question is whether the wheel has been stolen.  Last
month the city council, concerned that outgoing Mayor Marion Barry was
using his final weeks in office to grant favors to cronies, required
that he submit all contracts over $1 million for approval.  Barry
responded by vetoing the measure.  MAYOR-ELECT SHARON PRATT DIXON, WHO
PROMISED TO FIRE 2,000 BUREAUCRATS, LEARNED THAT THE TASK WILL BE MORE
DIFFICULT THAN SHE ASSUMED.  More than half of Barry's top political
appointees may be protected by the civil-service system, making them
virtually pink-slip-proof.

By:  Charles Leerhsen with Peter Katel in Miami

2nd column	1st paragraph
Anyone who calls himself Yahweh should be viewed with skepticism.
Hulon Mitchell Jr. calls himself Yahweh Ben Yahweh ("God the son of
God").  He wears flowing robes, claims to be the leader of a lost
black tribe of Israel and makes speeches in which he says his
followers, no Jews, are the original Semites.  The 55-year-old leader
would be as dismissible as any other full-bearded, self-proclaimed
savior if not for one thing:  he can deliver as many as 12,000 votes
to politicians in and around Miami, where his cult, the Nation of
Yahweh, prospers.  Those are the kinds of numbers that turn skepticism
to support, and so last month Miami Mayor Xavier Suarez proclaimed
Yahweh Ben Yahweh Day.  "They do inculcate a certain lwefulness and
discipline in their members, which is admirable," the mayor once said.
According to a federal grand jury, though, the cult's methods are
anything but admirable.  THIS YAHWEH DOESN'T BELIEVE IN AN EYE FOR AN
EYE:  THE INDICTMENT SAYS FOLLOWERS SOMETIMES BROUGHT HIM A VICTIM'S
EAR.

It's like three Catholics get together and plan a robbery or a murder.

remaining silent if John Paul II went to jail.  "I wouldn't try to

	BITTER BATTLE
By:  Andrew Nagorski in Warsaw

1st column	2nd paragraph
These days the people of Poland are being inundated in the rhetoric of
democracy.  And this time it's for real.  The country's Nov. 25
presidential election is the first in postcommunist Eastern Europe to
pit one noncommunist against another.  No more one-sided contests
between once outlawed political parties and the old-time regimes.  No
more easy choices between the heroes of the revolution and their
onetime jailers.  This is a power struggle between leaders who both
fought on the same side of the barricades- but who now differ greatly
over the direction Poland should follow.  Some Poles are finding the
transition hard to accept.  "FOR THE FIRST TIME," SAYS SOCIOLOGIST
TADEUSZ SZAWIEL, "THEY WILL HAVE TO BE AGAINST SOMEONE WITH WHOM THEY
ARE EMOTIONALLY TIED."

3rd paragraph to top of 2nd column
WALESA PLAYS MOST EASILY ON THOSE TIES.  HE TELLS HIS AUDIENCES THAT
HE WANTS TO BE PRESIDENT ONLY TO ACCELERATE POLAND'S TRANSITION TO
DEMOCRACY AND A DECENT STANDARD OF LIVING.  "The richer you are, the
richer Poland will be," he says.  He is a virtuoso campaigner.  His
standard pitch begins with an appeal "not to let yourselves be
directed by emotions, even toward me."  but he soon assures his
audience, "I am one of you," and points out his rural origins and
working-class pedigree.  The he may float one of his economic-reform
proposals- a scheme to offer every Pole more than $10,000 to set up a
new business.  Walesa calls it an interest-free, 20-year loan.

3rd column	1st paragraph
ALTHOUGH WALESA NO LONGER BOASTS HE WILL WIN 80 PERCENT OF THE VOTE,
HE RADIATES CONFIDENCE THAT HE WILL EXCEED THE 50 PERCENT REQUIRED FOR
VICTORY IN THE FIRST ROUND DESPITE THE PRESENCE OF FOUR MNOR
CANDIDATES.  Mazowiecki's chances are "minimal," he told NEWSWEEK, and
the best thing for Poland would be his withdrawal from the race; under
those condition, Walesa says, Mazowiecki could stay on as prime
minister.  However, Mazowiecki told NEWSWEEK he had made "a choice
connected with a certain vision of democracy and the presidency,"
leaving no doubt that he is in the race to the end.

WHAT I FEAR IS A CERTAIN CHAOS AND WASTE OF WHAT HAS BEEN ACHIEVED
OVER THE PAST YEAR.
-Tadeusz Mazowiecki

pg. 48		1st column	1st paragraph
Historian Bronislaw Geremek, who supported Mazowiecki, stepped down
last week as the leader of the Solidarity bloc in Parliament.  In his
place the legislators chose a former steelworker who backs Walesa.
"One Solidarity elite has been at the top for 10 years," says Walesa
adviser Zdzislaw Najder.  "It's time for a change in elites."  The
change mirrors a larger class conflict.   WALESA LEADS AMONG WORKERS,
OLDER PEOPLE ON PENNSIONS AND THOSE WHO FEEL THEY HAVE SACRIFICED MOST
UNDER THE "SHOCK THERAPY" ECONOMIC POLICIES INTRODUCED EARLY THIS
YEAR.  Support for the highly cultured Mazowiecki is strongest among
urban intellectuals; the more educated a voter, the more likely he is
to support ROAD.

3rd paragraph
TO HIS MOST FERVENT OPPONENETS, WALESA WOULD BE DANGERSOU EITHER IN
VICTORY OR IN DEFEAT.  IF HE LOSES, THEY FEAR, HE COULD DESTABILIZE
THE COUNTRY BY INSTIGATING NEW POPULAR PROTESTS.  WALESA DENIES ANY
SUCH INTENTION BUT ARGUES THAT HE ALONE COMMANDS ENOUGH AUTHORITY TO
LEAD POLAND THROUGH THE NEXT STAGE OF DIFFICULT REFORMS.  If he wins?
He has hinted that he may keep some of Mazowiecki's team, particularly
Finance Minister Balcerowicz, to demonstrate that he is continuing
rather than breaking with the reforms already in place.  He remains a
formidable figure, grudgingly respected even by some of those who now
oppose him.  "At difficult moments, Walesa has always come to his
senses and been able to choose the best solution," says Sen. Andrzej
Celinski, a Mazowiecki supporter.  But Mazowiecki has already proven
that he can make the kind of unpopular decisions required by the
country's desperate circumstances.  No one ever said that democracy
was easy, and Poland is learning that lesson this month.

His followers claimed that Kahane, 58, was the victim of an
orchestrated Arab hit.  But New York City police said the accused
killer apparently acted alone.  POLICE GAVE THIS ACCOUNT:  EL SAYYID
A. NOSAIR, 34, WAS FRUSTRATED THAT IN SPITE OF HIS ENGINEERING
TRAINING IN EGYPT, THE BEST JOB HE COULD FIND HERE WAS AS A
MAINTENANCE WORKER FOR THE CITY; A FAMILY MEMBER SAID HE WAS TAKING
THE ANTIDEPRESSION DRUG PROZAC.  A devout Muslim who emigrated to the
United States in 1981, Nosair read a newspaper ad for the speaking
engagement.  He went to the hotel and shot Kahane in the neck at close
range as he spoke to a Zionist group about his plan to expel all Arabs
from Israel.  Nosair fled, but was shot and wounded by a postal police
officer about a block away.  Nosair denied he killed Kahane.

3rd paragraph to top of 3rd column
In life, Kahane showled little interest in making friends.  Born
Martin Kahane in Brooklyn, he styled himself a militant Zionist in the
mold of Menachem Begin but informed on leftists for the FBI, swindled
investors and flagrantly broke his marriage vows.  YET MANY WEALTHY

VIOLENT LEGACY:  Though stymied as a politician, Kahane helped lead
Israel's decade-old shift to the right.  He made the once

OUTRIGHT, A POLL PUBLISHED FRIDAY SAID.  Several Knesset parties
openly espouse some kind of "transfer" of Arabs to Jordan, Egypt and
other neighboring countries.  Kahane's organization is unlikely to

Even the efforts to simplify things have gotten complicated.  A

there is a crowd of competing seal- 10 at last count (chart).  While
stores like Wal-Mart use in-house green labels, environmentalists are

CONSUMERS NEED HELP:  A NEW SURVEY BY THE COUNCIL ON PLASTICS AND

2nd paragraph
Despite the boom, environmentalists were shaken by the loss of green
initiatives.  Why did they lose so big?  "the question is, will the
public spend whatever it takes?"  Says Barry Mannis, vice president
for environmental services at Morgan Stanley.  "For the moment, the
answer is no."  Some say recession jitters made voters reject measures
tht might have put a drag on the economy.  Others blame high
anti-green campaign spending by the business community- or, as in
California, even animosity toward one of the measure's sponsors, state
assemblyman Tom Hayden.  But perhaps the answer is more personal.
AMERICANS LIKE TO CHOOSE SAFER PRODUCTS, BUT RESENT HAVING CHOICES
TAKEN AWAY BY THE GOVERNMENT- AND SOMETIMES YOU WANT TO EAT A BURGER,

the election upsets can only add pressure to the delicate relationship

Title:  Is It Panic Time or Not?
Subheader:  THE REALITY- AND PSYCHOLOGY- OR RECESSION
By:  Rich Thomas in Washington

1st column	1st paragraph
Never in recent U.S. history has an economic downturn been so widely
advertised- and feared- before it even began.  Output may indeed be
slipping into reverse: even George Bush last week hinted as much.  But
the latest numbers still show business advancing.  Gross national
product rose in the third quarter, and so did industrial production.
The jobless rated marked time.  SO WHY HAS CONSUMER CONFIDENCE
SUDDENLY SUNK TO LEVELS SEEN ONLY IN THE DEPTHS OF HARSH RECESSIONS
(CHART)?  Are Americans overreacting?  Or are the government's numbers
not showing how bad things really are?

2nd paragraph
The answer is both.  ON THE PSYCHOLOGICAL FRONT, AMERICANS HAVE SWUNG
ABRUPTLY FROM THE HIGH OF PEACE AND PROSPERITY TO THE DREAD OF
RECESSION AND WAR.  On the statistical front, inflation, technological
change and the shifting demographics of the U.S. work force have
combined to make the economy look much stronger than it is.

3rd paragraph
The psychological part is simple.  In August Americans were still
enjoying an eighth straight year of growth and victory in the cold
war.  Then came the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.  The public, already
reading aout banking problems and a nationwide real-estate bust, saw
oil prices double from $20 to $40 a barrel.  President George Bush was
suddenly dispatching half the entire Army, Navy and Air Force to the
Middle East.  "WE'VE NEVER SEEN CONFIDENCE COLLAPSE THIS DEEP BEFORE
AN ACTUAL SLOWDOWN," SAYS JASON BRAM OF THE CONFERENCE BOARD, WHICH
TRACKS CONSUMER ATTITUDES.  "WE THINK THE WAR THREAT, AND MAYBE EVEN
THIS FALL'S LONG TAX BATTLE, HURT CONFIDENCE AS MUCH AS ECONOMIC
WEAKNESS."

2nd column	1st paragraph
Other depressants are also at work.  One is the specter of the Great
Depression.  THE COLLAPSE OF THE SAVINGS AND LOAN INDUSTRY AND NOW NEW
OF GIANT BANKING LOSSES FROM THE REAL-ESTATE CRUNCH "MAY POSSIBLY BE
RAISING FEARS," IN THE WORDS OF VICTOR ZARNOWITZ AT THE UNIVERSITY OF
CHICAGO, "OF A BANK CRASH LIKE THE ONE IN THE '30S, WHEN UNEMPLOYMENT
HIT 25 PERCENT."  This is highly unlikely; besides, deposits are now
insured.  BUT THE SHADOW OF HISTORY HAS PILED EXTRA ANXIETY ONTO
ALREADY EXAGGERATED FEARS ABOUT THE RECESSION.

3rd column	1st paragraph
The worst slowdown since World War II, in 1982, raised unemployment
from about 5 to 10.8 percent.  (Average recessions create a 7.5
percent jobless increase.)  Even then, only one person out of every 20
in the work force actually lost a job.  The other 29 were untouched.
In most downturns, "the overwhelming majority of persons go on doing
what they are doing and getting paid what they are paid," says Murray
Weidenbaum of Washington University in St. Louis.  "If inflation goes
down, as it usually does in recessions, the average person actually
comes out better off."  BUT THIS FACT IS GETTING DROWNED IN ANXIETY.
"THE SMALL CHANCE OF LOSING BIG THOUGH JOB LOSS IS FAR MORE
FRIGHTENING THAN THE HOPE OF GAINING A LITTLE FROM LOWER PRICES," SAWY
BRAM.  "IT'S JUST NO CONTEST."

3rd paragraph
The good news is that the labor-force slowdown will cushion the effect
of job loss throughout the coming slump.  BUT THAT'S SMALL COMFORT TO
THE THOUSANDS WHO HAVE ALREADY LOST THEIR JOBS- AND MANY MORE WHO
WORRY, RATIONALLY OR NOT, THAT THEY MIGHT BE NEXT.  As Weidenbaum
points out, "It's been a long time since we had [a recession], so
we're out of practice.  Overreacting is wrong, but it always happens.

IT'S NO SURPRISE THAT SO MANY CAPITAL HILL INCUMBENTS WON CHEERS FROM

spending cuts and tax increases, the politicians blinked.  Cuts turned
out to be modest; some popular programs like child care got a big leg
up and no one laid a glove on the average voter's income tax return.
For most Americans tax rates won't change, nor will exemptions and

$100,000 up.

TAX ISSUES ASIDE, THE BUDGET DEAL IS FULL OF SURPRISES TOUCHING
PRACTICALLY EVERYONE:

percent of your closing costs in cash rather than borrowing all of the
money and (2) a higher insurance fee, if you're putting less than 10
percent down.  The VA will raise its upfront fee for all borrowers,
the exact amount depending on the size of your down payment.  The VA's
increase is supposed to last for only one year.  Both the FHA and VA
loan-guarantee funds have been running in the red.

3rd column	2nd paragraph to top of pg. 57
On the bright side, the DVA will finally be able to discover who's
really impoverished and who's lying.  BELIEVE IT OR NOT, OFFICIALS
THERE HAVE HAD NOT RIGHT TO DOUBLECHECK AN APPLICANT'S FULL INCOME.
With few exceptions, they've had to take his or her word- costing
taxpayers tens of millions in improper payments.  The new law broadens
the DVA's authority to require social-security numbers from anyone
applying for veteran's benefits.  Also, all claimants' incomes can now
be run against IRS tapes to see who really qualifies.  It's believed
that some vets on the rolls are actually dead.

3rd column	1st paragraph
As for the ultimate firepower- fully automatic weapons- most police
departments keep a few, but allow SWAT teams to take them out only in
extraordinary situations.  The sole civilian agency routinely using
them is the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, which, faced with
heavily armed dealers, has issued all agents 9-mm Colt submachine guns
that fire 800 rounds a minute.  Some gunmakers say police sales are
growing as more departments develop tactical teams, but few predict
the U.S. cities will start resembling Europe or Latin America, where
machine-gun-toting cops are common.  "The minute we start looking like
an occupying army, we lose our public support," said Bud Meeks,

Title:  Not In His Own Words
Subheader:  DR. KING PLAGIARIZED SOME EARLY WRITINGS
By:  Bill Turque with Nadine Joseph in Palo Alto and Patrick Rogers in
	New York

1st column	1st paragraph
As a college freshman, Clyborne Carson attended the 1963 March on
Washington, where the Rev. Martin Luther King delivered his now
legendary "I have a dream" speach.  The Stanford University
historian's first book was a study of black awakening in the '60s.
When Coretta Scott King asked him to edit and publish her husband's
papers in 1985, it was another distinction in a long career of study
and personal dedication to the struggle for civil rights.  "BUT
CARSON'S SCHOLARSHIP LED HIM TO A DISTURBING DISCOVERY, DETAILED LAST
WEEK IN THE WALL STREET JOURNAL:  EXTENSIVE PORTIONS OF KING'S
ACADEMIC WRITINGS, INCLUDING THE DISSERTATION FOR HIS 1955 DOCTORAL
DEGREE FROM BOSTON UNIVERISTY, HAD BEEN PLAGIARIZED.  "Martin Luther
King Jr. was a great man," says Carson, "but a careless scholar."

2nd column	1st paragraph to top of 3rd column
Historians are at a loss to explain King's dubious scholarship.  It
almost certainly was not out of a need to cover up academic
shortcomings.  King had been in colleges, universities and seminaries
for 11 years by the time he submitted his dissertation; he earned
strong grades at Crozer and BU, and even took a course in thesis
writing.  One dispiriting possibility:  his teachers held him to a
lower standard of performance because he was black.  Carson and those
who worked with King suggest he had taken the oral traditions of the
black church with him to academia.  IN "VOICE MERGING," PREACHERS
SYNTHESIZE THE WORDS AND IDEAS OF THOSE WHO SPOKE BEFORE THEM.  As
Joseph Lowery of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference told the
New York Times:  "Preachers have an old saying.  The first time they
use somebody elses's work they give credit.  The second time, they say
some thinker said it.  The third time they just say it."

3rd column	1st paragraph
The real question is whether Carson's findings diminish King's legacy-
the majestically articulated vision of racial justice for which he won
the 1964 Nobel Peace Prize.  The historic value of the early papers in
question is virtually nil.  They carry no hint of the galvanizing
message he would one day deliver extemporaneously from the pulpit.
SCHOLARS HAVE KNOWN FOR YEARS THAT KING'S LATER BOOKS AND MAGAZINE
ARTICLES WERE WRITTEN BY OTHERS.  But such is the case with numerous
public figures.  "It's the element of submitting it for academic
credit that makes the difference," King biographer DavidGarrow told
NEWSWEEK.  It will diminish his reputation."

space for big dreamers.  DANCES WITH WOLVES, which Costner directed,
coproduced and stars in, is a sweeping, three-hour epic that mixes Old
Hollywood grandiosity with New Hollywood sensitivity.  As a filmmaker,
Costner reinforces the persona he's developed as a star.  LIKE THE
IDEALISTIC HERO OF "FIELD OF DREAMS," WHO FUSED COUNTERCULTURAL
SENTIMENTS WITH BUSH-ERA CONSERVATISM, COSTNER GIVES US AN AMBITIOUS
REVISIONIST READING OF THE FRONTIER WITHIN AN ESTHETICALLY
CONSERVATIVE FORM.  Redressing a century of Hollywood historical bias,
he presents the Wild West from the Native American point of view.
This time the Sioux Indians are the good guys, and almost every white
man in sight (our hero excepted) is a lout.  In a sense, he's merely
turned the old cliches inside out:  Costner's frontier remains a moral
landscape where only white hats and black hats are worn.  Only the
heads have changed.

pg. 68		1st column	1st paragraph
"Dances With Wolves" is vulnerable both to charges of sentimentality
and anachronism- the hero exhibits a sensibility at times dubiously
contemporary.  BUT IF ONE'S MIND SOMETIMES BALKS, ONE'S HEART EMBRACES
THE MOVIE'S FINE, WIDE-OPEN SPIRIT, ITS GENUINE RESPECT FOR A CULTURE
WE DESTROYED WITHOUT A SECOND THOUGHT.

4th paragraph
It's an engrossing tale, and Costner directs with the confidence of a
Hollywood veteran well aware that entertainment comes before
earnestness.  He has a showman's instinct for mixing violence, humor
and ormance, a painterly eye for epic landscapes and an almost
anthropological appreciation fo the Sioux people.  The large Native
American cast- Graham Greene as the wise Kicking Bird, Dunbar's first
ally; Rodney A. Grant as the more skeptical warrior Wind in His Hair,
and Floyd Red Crow Westerman as the old chief (all of whom speak in
the Lakota language)- create noble but believable human characters.
COSTNER IS NO LESS SHREWD SERVING HIMSELF UP:  LIKE ROBERT REDFORD, HE
UNDERSTANDS THAT UNDERSTATEMENT AND A TOUCH OF SELF-MOCKERY ENHANCE
HIS APPEAL.  Dunbar may be too good to be true to the period, but in
these cynical times it's nice to cheer for a soulful hero, a man who
realizes there's more to life than looking out for No. 1.  "Dances
With Wolves" has a true epic reach and a romantic generosity of spirit
that one is happy to succumb to.

Subheader:  NOW, REACH OUT AND TOUCH-TONE YOUR PSYCHOLOGIST
By:  Emily Yoffe

1st column	1st paragraph
WHEN COMEDIAN RICHARD LEWIS MOVED TO LOS ANGELES FROM NEW YORK IN THE
MID-'70S, HE REALIZED THAT HE NEEDED PSYCHOLOGICAL HELP MORE THAN
EVER, SO HE CONTINUED HIS GROUP THERAPY BY PHONE.  "my group
conference-called me," he says.  "I knew it was time for a change when
I heard the therapist say to one of the women, 'weep closer to the
phone'."  Lewis eventually found an L.A. shrink, but now he's on the
road so much that he often ends up having telephonic therapy with her.

middle of 2nd paragraph
Because of tight schedules and time-zone differences, these patients
often find themselves having therapy from pay phones, hotel rooms or
their offices.  Therapists say continuing a relationship by phone can
help patients move away without feeling disconnected.  "I THINK
TELEPHONE THERAPY IS ONE OF THE MAJOR THERAPIES OF THE FUTURE," SAYS
DR. ELLEN MCGRATH, A PSYCHOLOGIST IN PRIVATE PRACTICE IN NEW YORK
CITY.  But both doctors and patients acknowledge that therapy changes
when it becomes a long-distance relationship.

4th paragraph to top of 2nd column
But reaching out does not always mean touching.  Therapists say they
miss the nuances of their patients' body language and facial
expression, and vice versa.  And participants say home therapy lends
itself to quick fixes than free association.  Dr. Thomas Nagy, a
psychologist at the Stanford University School of Medicine in Palo
Alto, Calif., moved from Chicago four years ago and found himself on
the phone with a group of patients who were not ready to face a new
therapist.  HE THOUGHT THAT THE SESSIONS BECAME MORE LIKE "SUPPORTIVE
DISCUSSIONS" THAN RIGOROUS THERAPY.  "There's nothing wrong with
that," he says, "but they were less interesting and exploratory.  They
didn't have the same forward movement."

2nd column	1st paragraph to top of 3rd column
Therapists'professional organizations do not have formal positions on
the subject, but spokesmen say the groups have no ethical objection to
properly handled phone therapy.  Still, some professionals have
qualms.  Classical analysis would be inapropriate over the phone, says
Richard Weiss, a psychiatrist and member of the New York
Psychoanalytic Society.  "WHEN YOU'RE DOING ANALYSIS YOU ARE
FOCUSING ON WHAT THE PATIENT IS EXPERIENCING MOMENT TO MOMENT," HE
SAYS.  "To do that on the phone is such a distortion of the
interpersonal atmosphere."  Dr. Weiss adds that the phone my
exacerbate certain psychological problems.  "Often therapy is dealing
with how a patient does or doesn't feel close to people.  Doing it
over the phone gives the patient a place to hide."

3rd column	1st paragraph
Says Dr. Nagy, who has researched the subject for the American
Psychological Association:  "The question for the therapist is:  are
you depriving a patient of a better quality of care in a face-to-face
setting with someone in the same city?"  HE CONFRONTED THE LIMITATIONS
OF HIS PHONE WORK WHEN HE DISCOVERED HE COULDN'T TELL A PATIENT HAD
BROKEN DOWN IN SOBS.  "This patient had a multiple-personality
disorder.  I HAD NO IDEA HE WAS CRYING UNTIL AN ALTERNATE
[PERSONALITY] CAME ON THE PHONE AND SAID, 'DOCTOR, DON'T YOU KNOW
TEARS ARE STREAMING DOWN HIS FACE?'"

2nd paragraph
COMFORT ZONE:  YET DESPITE THE DRAWBACKS OF HARDWARE AND DISTANCE, IT
IS SOOTHING TO KNOW THERE'S SOMEONE WHO CARES AT THE OTHER END OF THE
LINE.  ONE BICOASTAL ADVERTISING EXECUTIVE, WHO CONDUCTS MUCH OF HER
BUSINESS OVER THE PHONE, HAS FOUND HER FOUR YEARS OF PHONE THERAPY IN
SOME WAYS PREFERABLE TO BEING THERE.  When she calls her New York
therapist from her Los Angeles bedroom early in the morning, "I'm in
my robe, in a very comfortable therapeutic space having an intimate
conversation in an intimate setting.  I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT THERE WAS A
CERTAIN ARTIFICIALITY TO A THERAPIST AND A PATIENT SITTING IN TWO
CHAIRS FACING EACH OTHER."  AUSTIN, TEXAS, PSYCHOLOGIST MARY TEAGUE HS
HAD SO MANY PATIENTS MOVE AND STAY IN CONTACT OVER THE PHONE THAT SHE
JOKES, "SOMETIMES I THINK I COULD JUST TALK ON THE PHONE AND HAVE A
PRACTICE."

Title:  Attention, K mart Shoppers!
Subheader:  LIVE LIKE MARTHA STEWARD FOR A MERE $3 A MONTH
By:  Jerry Adler

1st column	1st paragraph
For all her countless fans who could never get too much of Martha
Stewart... well, now they can.  With the appearance this week of her
new magazine, martha Stewart Living, the most famous caterer ever to
come out of Westport, Conn., joins Malcolm Forbes, Ellery queen and a
handful of other luminaries so admired that their names alone can
command attention on the nation's newsstands.  There's Martha on the
cover, radiating suburban perfection from a wicker porch chair.  There
she is again, picking her Christmas tree, dyeing pumpkins, making
holly weraths, smiling demurely on her family's 1951 Christmas card- a
total of 10 appearances in 132 pages.  SHE HAS THUS ACHIEVED WHAT MANY
WOMEN WOULD CONSIDER THE WORLD'S GREATEST JOB:  EDITOR IN CHIEF OF HER
OWN MAGAZINE AND PERMANENT COVER GIRL.

2nd column	1st paragraph to top of 3rd column
Living extends Martha Stewart's efforts to proselytize among the
middle class, efforts that began, amid some ridicule, with her 1987
licensing deal with K mart.  The market for Martha Stewart Living, the
editor in chief says, is "everyone who buys my books, plus all the
people who would like to buy them and can't go out and spend $50 on
one."  She makes a point on how "accessible" her advice is, and she's
right, in the sense of "inexpensive."  ON THE OTHER HAND, ANYONE WHO
TOOK HER ADVICE AND BOUGHT AN OLD CHANDELIER AT A GARAGE SALE AND
ATTEMPTED TO RESTORE IT HERSELF, SAVING $6,000 OR SO IN THE PROCESS,
MIGHT CONCLUDE THAT IT WOULD BE EASIER TO START LIFE ALL OVER WITH A
RICH HUSBAND.  Time Warner Inc., which is publishing Martha Stewart
Living, will distribute 500,000 copies of the first issue nationwide,
at a cover price of $3.  THEY WILL STAY ON THE NEWSSTANDS FOR SIX
WEEKS; A SECOND TEST ISSUE IS PLANNED FOR MARCH, AFTER WHICH-
DEPENDING ON HOW WELL IT DOES- IT MAY BEGIN APPEARING REGULARLY,
PERHAPS AS A BIMONTHLY.

3rd column	middle of 1st paragraph
A reporter asked if she has a Manhattan pied-a-terre for those late

Title:  From Peaks to Valleys
Subheader:  DOES ANYONE STILL CARE WHO KILLED LAURA PALMER?
By:  Joshua Hammer

1st column	1st paragraph
BY THE TIME YOU READ THIS YOU'LL PROBABLY KNOW THE ENDING TO
TELEVISION'S BIGGEST MYSTERY SINCE J. R. EWING NEARLY GOT BUMPED OFF
IN "DALLAS" BACK IN 1980.  The question is- will you care?  LONG
BEFORE THE MUCH-HYPED DENOUEMENT OF ABC'S "TWIN PEAKS" FINALLY AIRED
LAST SATURDAY NIGHT, ENTHUSIASM FOR THE QUIRKY SERIES HAD GROWN COLDER
THA A DAY-OLD CUP OF JOE.  Just ask "Twin Peaks" fan David Jefferson.
A Wall Street Journal reporter in Los Angeles, Jefferson decided to
organize a "Who Killed Laura Palmer?" party on Nov. 10 and posted a
sign-up sheet on his office bulletin board.  "I HAD VISIONS OF GETTING
A SECOND TV BECAUSE MY APARTMENT WOULD BE BULGING AT THE SEAMS WITH
PEOPLE," HE SAYS.  Jefferson took down the sheet four days later-
after attracting just one signature.  "I'm a latecomer to this show,"
sighs Jefferson.  "Now I'm being deserted.  Nobody wants to come to my
party."

2nd column	2nd paragraph to top of 3rd column
But other experts say that ABC goofed by burying its best shows on a
dead night.  "When you put 'China Beach' and 'Twin Peaks' on Saturday,
you're saying these two shows have no ability to grow," says David
Poltrack, CBS's senior vice president for research and planning.
Indeed, both shows are losing members of the young audience they might
attract on a weeknight.  Cleve Keller, a 22-year-old Manhattan
publicist, avidly watched "Twin Peaks" with eight friends every
Thursday last spring.  "We ate doughnuts- and we adapted the show's
dialogue into our daily speech, saying things like 'damn fine cup o'
coffee'," she says.  "BUT NOBODY'S HOME SATURDAY NIGHT, AND WE'VE ALL
PUT THE SHOW OUT OF OUR MINDS."

3rd column	1st paragraph
Some viewers say they're frustrated by the show's creative drift.
TRACY HARSHMAN OF YOUNGSTOWN, OHIO, GOT FED UP WITH THE KNOTTY PLOT
AND THE WRITERS STUBBORN REFUSAL TO RESOLVE ITS MANY MYSTERIES.  "Each
week they do wonderfully creative things, but they go in a million
directions," she complains.  AFTER MISSING A COUPLE OF EARLY
ESPISODES, BILL BOWMAN, A LAWYER FROM CHEVY CHASE, MD., SAYS HE "FOUND
MYSELF HELPLESSLY CONFUSED AND WONDERING WHY NOBODY ON THE SHOW SEEMS
TO CARE WHO KILLED LAURA PALMER ANYMORE."  Others say they're tired of
creator David Lynch's weirdness for weirdness's sake- the
intergalactic telegrams, the giant night visitors, the
orchid-cultivating keeper of Laura Palmer's diary.  SAYS NEW YORK
ATTORNEY FRANZ PAASCHE:  "THERE IS THIS UNCOMFORTABLE SENSE THAT THE
WHOLE SHOW IS A JOKE ON THE VIEWER."

2nd paragraph
Can "Twin Peaks" survive?  Well, somebody pushed Pocket Books' "The
Secret Diary of Laura Palmer" to fifth place on The New York Times's
trade-paperback best-seller list.  CULTISTS STILL DEBATE "PEAKS"
ESOTERICA, PONDERING, FOR INSTANCE, WHETHER A MYSTERIOUS NEW JAPANESE
CHARACTER IS REALLY CATHERINE MARTELL IN DISGUISE.  MARK FROST,
COCREATOR OF THE SHOW, SAYS THAT HE'S "DISAPPOINTED" BY THE POOR
RATINGS, BUT INSISTS THAT ABC HAS PROMISED TO MOVE THE SHOW TO A
WEEKNIGHT "IF IT ISN'T WORKING."  Others don't see how the show can
last.  "I think ABC would really like this show to die," says Kitman.
ABC insists it's on the right track, and has even begun exploiting its
strategy in its promotions.  One spot shows nervous ABC executives
being chewed out by their boss for scheduling "the best shows on TV"
on Saturday night.  The tag line urges viewers to watch the programs
and "save our jobs."  If "Twin Peaks" ratings don't improve soon, they
may have a real reason to worry.

Title:  The Wonder Boom Years
Subheader:  A MUSEUM EXAMINES POSTNUCLEAR CHILDHOOD
By:  Katrine Ames with Daniel Glick in Washington

1st column	1st paragraph
Money.  Television.  The bomb.  Seperately, any would have altered a
generation.  Together, the unholy trinity conspired to make the
childhood of 76 million Americans born between 1946 and 1964 from any
that proceded it.  In a booming postwar economy, the growing middle
class suddenly had disposable income- and they often disposed of it on
their offspring.  In the first decade after World War II, the toy
business nearly tripled; by the late '50s it was a billion-dollar
industry.  Electronic marketing arrived on a large scale, aimed at a
particularly receptive audience:  kids hooked on such commercial-laced
elixers as "Howdy Doody" and "leave It to Beaver."  BUT ABOVE (OR
BENEATH) THIS PPARENT IDYLL WHERE FATHER ALWAYS KNEW BEST, THERE WAS
THE THREAT OF ARMAGEDDON.  At any minute, you, the Beave and your Davy
Crockett hat might be vaporized by atomic weapons unleashed by
communists.  AT THE NATIONAL MUSEUM OF AMERICAN HISTORY IN WASHINGTON,
A NEW EXHIBITION, "THIS IS YOUR CHILDHOOD, CHARLIE BROWN:  CHILDREN
AND AMERICAN CULTURE, 1945-1968," EXAMINES GROWING UP IN THE ENIGMATIC
EARLY DAYS OF THE NUCLEAR AGE.

2nd column	1st paragraph
FREUD NEVER ASKED, "WHAT DOES A CHID WANT?"  BUT IN THE 44 YEARS SINCE
BENJAMIN SPOCK PUBLISHED "THE COMMON SENSE BOOK OF BABY AND CHILD
CARE," MILLIONS OF AMERICANS HAVE BEEN NEARLY OBSESSED WITH THE
QUESTION.  With changing social climates, they keep coming up with
different answers.  IN THE "TOGETHERNESS PERIOD THE MUSEUM SHOW
FOCUSES ON, WHAT KIDS WANTED- MORE ACCURATELY, WHAT THEIR PARENTS,
TELEVISION PROGRAMMERS AND OTHERS WANTED THEM TO WANT- WAS CHEERFUL
CONFORMITY AND UNQUESTIONING OBEDIENCE.  What the exhibit (which runs
until April 30) best illustrates is that during the Wonder Bread
years, there was plenty of burnt toast.

3rd column	4th paragraph
WHAT'S ASTONISHING IS HOW PERSPICACIOUS THOSE STRIPS WERE- EVEN TO
SCHULZ, WHO DOES NOT CONSIDER HIMSELF A SOCIAL CRITIC.  AFTER
RE-EXAMINING HIS EARLY WORK, THE CARTOONIST SAID TO CURATOR MCGOVER,
"IT'S ALL THERE, ISN'T IT?"  Nor did McGovern have to stretch a point:
"For every one we picked there were four others that could have taken
its place, " he says.

6th paragraph
The post-nuke generation may not have invented nostalgia, but it did
turn it into a lifestyle.  While still in their teens, the first of
the baby boomers discovered the '30s and early '40s, particularly the
period's movies, and romanticized the era that gave us Hitler,
Mussolini and global economic depression.  Not to mention Spam.  Now
the boomers are romanticizing their own past, paying huge sums for the
tattered totems of their own childhood.  (McGovern even had some
difficulty assembling the Smithsonian show because collectors have
hoarded so many items.)  The exhibition let some light in on the dark
side of childhood, but McGovern cautions against turning "Peanuts"
into a metaphor.  "This is a comic strip," he says.  "It's not a guide
to life.  SHULZ IS A CHRONICLER, AND FOR THIS PERIOD OF TIME, HE WAS
TAPPED INTO THE GREATER CURRENTS."

ARKO, PRESIDENT OF PIER 39, "THIS IS HOME."  Arko can barely make
himself heard, as he proudly points to the pungent pinnipeds carrying
on just 50 feet below beyond a lock gate.  They're constantly barking
and yelping as they shove one another off the dock in an aquatic
version of King of the Hill.  The clever ones try sneak attacks by
swimming under the the dock to blindside the bigger players; they
usually get pummeled.  "It's more exciting than an aquarium," says
8-year-old Neal Burgner, visiting his mother.

2nd column	2nd paragraph
EXPERTS WORRY THAT THE SEA OF YOSEMITE:  TOO USED TO PEOPLE AND TOO
LAZY TO HUNT FOR FOOD.  "They're slugs," says Brian Gibeson, a Bay
Area marine biologist.  "They'd do anything for fish and Pier 39 is
the ultimate deli."  But whether they stick around or return to their
natural migratory habits along the Pacific coast, the sea lions have
been immortalized in a truly San Franciscan way.  Intrigued by their
sounds, composer Doug McKechnie recorded the best barks of the bay and
used computer technology to produce a song that would make Tony Bennet

Title:  Made in Japan:  Better Baseball
By:  Bill Powell in Tokyo

3rd column	2nd paragraph
THE JAPANESE ALL-STARS SWEPT THE FIRST FOUR GAMES OF LAST WEEK'S
"EXHIBITION" SERIES WHICH, IN JAPAN, WAS CALLED THE "SUPER MAJOR
SERIES" AND WAS TELEVISED LIVE, NATIONWIDE, EVERY DAY, WHICH MIGHT
GIVE YOU A HINT ABOUT WHO THOUGHT IT WAS AN "EXHIBITION" AND WHO
DIDN'T.  And, as the saying goes, the Japanese made it look easy, in
part because the U.S. players dozed at the plate and committed four
errors a game.  Finally, in the fifth game, they came from behind to
win one.  But the Japanese clinched the series the next day in a way
that must have seemed inscrutable to the U.S. side:  the teams played
to a 6-6 draw (in Japan games can end in ties), guaranteeing that
Japan would win the overall series for only the second time since its
inception in 1908.

4th paragraph
Commissioner Vincent finally conceded that the series was "an
embarrassment."  In Japan, one sportswriter wrote politely that the
American's couldn't possibly be trying.  A TV ANALYST SAID THAT THE
JAPANESE IMPROVED, SHOWING THE AMERICANS THAT THEY COULD NO LONGER
ASSUME VICTORY.  Still, one American banker now working in Japan was
inconsolable.   "We're no even No. 1 in baseball anymore," he wailed.

Russian vodka.  Marty downed shot after shot until he vomited on
someone's leg.  HE THINKS HE SPENT AN HOUR FACE DOWN IN THE MIDDLE OF
THE STREET.  THE AMBULANCE RIDE TO THE HOSPITAL WAS A BLUR, TOO.  IN

Alcohol consumption is down throughout the country, but "this news has

professor at Harvard School of Public Health.  HE SURVEYED THE

FOUND THAT AMONG THOSE WHO DRINK AT LEAST ONCE A WEEK, 92 PERCENT OF
THE MEN AND 82 PERCENT OF THE WOMENT CONSUME AT LEAST FIVE DRINKS IN A
ROW.  FULLY HALF SAID THEY WANTED TO GET DRUNK.

3rd column	1st paragraph
Some officials blame the return to the 21-year-old minimum drinking
age.  Students have been forced to move their parties off campus where
they lap up dangerous spiked punches rather than beer.  "WE WANT TO

THEM," SAYS ROBERT SHERWOOD, BOSTON COLLEGE'S DEAN FOR STUDENT
DEVELOPMENT, WHOO SUPPORTS A RETURN TO THE 18-YEAR-OLD MINIMUM.

3rd paragraph
The alcohol problem on campus remains so widespread that 56 colleges
met last week at Harvard University to discuss strategies for more
aggressive education and counseling programs.  BUT COLLEGES REALLY
HAVE LITTLE IDEA WHAT WILL WORK.  Some have even resorted to a once
unimaginabl option- having students arrested for minor offenses.
Harsh perhaps, but preferable to waiting for one of the partygoers to

Title:  The Voters Speak:  Read Our Lips, If You Can

1st paragraph
WITH 45 EDUCATION INITIATIVES ON BALLOTS IN 24 STATES LAST WEEK, THE
PUBLIC HAD ITS BEST CHANCE THIS YEAR TO SPEAK ABOUT EDUCATION REFORM.
AND IT RESPONDED WITH A RESOUNDING MAYBE, SHOWING UNMISTAKABLE
SKEPTICISM ABOUT BOTH NEW REFORMS AND THE MORE CONVENTIONAL TACTIC OF
THROWING MORE MONEY AT THE PROBLEM.  Most of the balloting was heavily
influenced by state and local factors.  There was, says Michael Kirst,
a professor of education at Stanford University, "no backlash on
education."  But neither, says Frank Newman, president of the
Education Commission of the States, was there any "willingness to do
something radical."  Here is how several of the most significant
initiatives fared:

2nd column	1st paragraph
OREGON:  Voters handily defeated a referendum that would have granted
$2,500 in tax credits to families that choose to send their children
to private schools or educate them at home.  Opponents charged that
voucers would undermine the public-school system by draining off $95
million for children already attending private schools.  Nationally,
proponents viewed the Oregon measure as a litmus test for the
"parental choice" movement.  "THE PUBLIC KEEPS SAYING IT WANTS MORE
CHOICE," SAYS STANFORD'S KIRST.  "But not one of these propositions
has ever passed."  Oregonians also decided to put a cap on school
property-tax assessments.

3rd column 	3rd paragraph to top of 4th column
MASSACHUSETTS:  The voters rejected one of the most sweeping antitax
measure on any state ballot.  In Massachusetts, 40 percent of a school
district's budget comes from state aid.  "There's a kind of
conventional wisdom that any time you ask people to lower their taxes
they're going to say yes.  THE MESSAGE ACTUALLY GOT THROUGH THE VOTERS
THAT THIS PETITION THREATENED THEIR WELL-BEING," SAYS MARC LANDY, A
POLITICAL-SCIENCE PROFESSOR AT BOSTON COLLEGE.

4th column	1st paragraph
NEBRASKA:  Voters refused to repeal the state's seven-month-old
school-financing law that levies higher state sales and income taxes.
THE LAW IS MEANT TO CLOSE THE SPENDING GAP BETWEEN SCHOOLS IN
PROPERTY-RICH DISTRICTS AND THOSE IN POOR DISTRICTS BY IMPOSING
SPENDING LIMITS AND ROLLBACKS ON PROPERTY TAXES.

DEMOCRATS DID WELL ON TUESDAY BUT, AS THEY TURN TO THE TASK OF
UNHORSING GEORGE BUSH TWO NOVEMBERS FROM NOW, THEY SHOULD WORRY ABOUT
WRINGING LESSONS FROM THE ODD RESULTS.  A recurring theme was
resentment of taxes, so the more liberal party prospered in a
conservative season.

5th paragraph
ENTERING 1991 MANY DEMOCRATS WILL HAVE ONE IDEA:  SQUEEZE THE RICH
UNTIL THEY SQUEAK.  REPUBLICANS ARE HOPING THE DEMOCRATS WILL, AS IS
THEIR WONT, GO TOO FAR.  THE MORE DEMOCRATS CRY "TAX THE RICH!" THE
MORE DEMOCRATS ARE DEFINED BY THE WORD "TAX."  DEMOCRATS ARE HOPING
BUSH WILL RETURN TO HIS CRUSADE FOR CUTTING CAPITAL GAINS TAXES.  The
Democrats' can be a surtax on millionaires.  Then the issue will be
framed in their favor.

2nd column	1st paragraph
ANOTHER DANGER FOR DEMOCRATS IS THEIR DESIRE TO RESUSCITATE THE 1990
CIVIL-RIGHTS BILL THAT BUSH VETOED.  Democrats may also become defined
by another word, "quotas," just as the politics of race is becoming
more complex.  The Congressional Black Caucus now must grit its teeth
and accept the integration:  A conservative Republican is coming.
There goes the nieghborhood.

3rd paragraph
The president, too, has some dangerous defining to do, of himself.
When he was squished in the 1988 Iowa caucuses (he finished third
behind Bob Dole and Pat Robertson, with just 18.6 percent of the
votes) he put on a new person- the Mugger from Yale.  He derailed Dole
in New Hampshire with ads calling Dole "Senator Straddle" because Dole
was less than categorical in promising no new taxes.  Then Bush
rounded on Dukakis.  BUT, AS PRESIDENT, BUSH HAS WANTED TO GET ALONG
BY GOING ALONG WITH WASHINGTON'S DIFFERENCE-SPLITTING AND
IDEOLOGY-BLURRING POLITICAL BAZAAR.

4th paragraph
REMARKABLE SUCCESSES:  The third president in his first Inaugural
Address said, "We are all Republicans, we are all Federalists."  But
Jefferson actually practiced a fiercer partisanship than is seen
today.  (The Alien and Sedition Acts, passed just three years before
Jefferson proclaimed the end of partisanship, were framed by
Federalists to punish Republicans.)  THE 41ST PRESIDENTS SAID IN HIS
INAUGURAL ADDRESS THAT AMERICANS WANT WASHINGTON "TO RISE ABOVE THE
MERELY PARTISAN."  IF SO, THEY HAVE AN ODD WAY OF EXPRESSING THAT
WISH:  THEY GIVE DIFFERENT BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT TO DIFFERENT
PARTIES.

6th paragraph
California is a microcosm of the nation (not very micro: one in nine
citizens lives there), and its recent political history mirrors
America's mood.  CALIFORNIANS, SAYS PROF. CHARLES KESSLER, HAVE TWO
STRONG DESIRES THAT ARE PROVING TO BE CONTRADICTORY.  THEY WANT
ENERGETIC, OMNIPROVIDENT GOVERNMENT, BUT THEY WANT IT UNDER CONTROL.
CONVINCED THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS BECOME AUTONOMOUS, THEY HAVE TRIED
TO CONTROL IT BY TAX LIMITS (1978'S PROPOSITION 13), AND NOW BY TERM
LIMITS, AND ALMOST ALWAYS BY VOTING FOR DIVIDED GOVERNMENT.  LAST
TUESDAY THE NATION, TOO, AGAIN SAID CLEARLY THAT IT IS COMFORTABLE
WITH DIVIDED GOVERNMENT.  That means permanent partisan conflict
between two branches of government claiming contradictory mandates.
GOVERNMENT RARELY WORKS WELL THIS WAY, BUT TODAY, WHEN REPRESENTATIVE
GOVERNMENT IS GRIDLOCKED, IT IS, IN ONE SENSE, SUCCEEDING:  IT IS
FAITHFULLY REPRESENTING THE CONTRADICTION IN THE ELECTORATE'S MIND.
