Title:  Moscow's Two-Edged Plowshare
Subheader:  THE SOVIET UNION GAINS A FOOTHOLD IN THE GULF
By:  Russel Watson with Margaret Garrard Warner and Fred Coleman in
	Moscow
 
1st column	1st paragraph
There aren't many statesmen who have discussed the Persian Gulf Crisis
in depth with both George Bush and Saddam Hussein.  One who has,
Soviet envoy Yevgeny Primakov, has become a professional optimist.  "I
AM CONFIDENT THAT A PEACEFUL SOLUTION IS POSSIBLE," HE SAID LST WEEK
DURING A RECEPTIN IN THE KREMLIN.  SOVIET SOURCES CONCEDE THAT AFTER
TWO SESSIONS WITH THE UBIQUITOUS PRIMAKOV LAST MONTH, SADDAM SHOWS NO
SIGN OF ACTUAL MOVEMENT TOWARD A COMPROMISE.  Even so, the role of
peacemaker has paid off handsomely for Primakov and for the Kremlin.

2nd column	1st paragraph
Last week Secretary of State James Baker talked with Shevardnadze for
13 hours at President Mikhail Gorbachev's dacha outside Moscow.  THE
AMERICANS SAID GORBACHEV WAS DISMAYED BY PRIMAKOV'S LACK OF SUCCESS
WITH SADDAM.  ACCORDING TO SOVIET SOURCES, SADDAM WAS WILLING TO
CONSIDER A COMPROMISE SETTLEMENT, UNDER WHICH HE MIGHT ULTIMATELY
OBTAIN TWO KUWAITI ISLANDS AND CONTROL OVER A DISPUTED OILFIELD.  BUT
HE WAS NOT WILLING TO START THE PROCESS BY COMPLETELY WITHDRAWING HIS
FORCES FROM THE EMIRATE, AS DEMANDED BY THE INTERNATIONAL COALITION
ARRAYED AGAINST HIM.

2nd paragraph to top of 3rd column
AMERICAN OFFICIALS AND SOME SOVIET ANALYSTS BELIEVE GORBACHEV HAS
CONFLICTING OBJECTIVES.  HE WANTS A PARTNERSHIP WITH WASHINGTON, BUT
HE ALSO WANTS TO MAKE SURE THAT MOSCOW COMES OUT ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF
WHATEVER HAPPENS IN THE GULF.  Since the Crisis began, the Kremlin has
kept up relations with Baghdad, deciding to leave  thousands of
oilfield workers and at least 133 military specialists in Iraq until
their work contracts were completed.  Moscow also has agressively
courted other countries that can help it, economically or politically,
improving its relations with Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Israel.

column 3	1st paragraph
ARABIST OUTLOOK:  An academic specialist and former journalist in the
Middle East, Primakov, 61, is an influential member of Gorbachev's
Presidential Council.  As an Arabist, he represents a bureaucratic
mind-set at odds with that of Shevardnadze, for whom the U.S.-Soviet
relationship is of paramount importance.  "PRIMAKOV LOOKS AT SADDAM,
AND HE SEES A LONGSTANDING SOVIET RELATIONSHIP THAT HE WANTS TO
PRESERVE IF HE POSSIBLY CAN," SAYS ANDREI KORTUNOV, AN ANALYST AT
MOSCOW'S INSTITUTE FOR THE U.S.A. AND CANADA.  By allowing Primakov to
play a conspicuous role in the crisis, Gorbachev keeps his Arab
options open for as long as he can.

2nd paragraph
Some hard-liners charge that "Gorbachev and Shevardnadze are
continually yielding to the West without thinking through the Soviet
Union's long-term interests," Kortunov says.  GORBACHEV ALSO HAS TO
REMEMBER THAT IF HE SUPPORTS A MILITARY CRACKDOWN ON SADDAM, HE MAY
STIR UP NEW UNREST IN HIS OWN MUSLIM REPUBLICS.  Thus he has to keep
his distance from Washington, even if he agrees with U.S. policy.  The
payoff could be that, once the dust settles, Gorbachev's "good cop"
will be a lot more popular among the Arabs than Bush's tough enforcer.

Title:  Letters in the Sand
By:  Tom Mathews with Tony Clifton in Saudi Arabia, Vern E. Smith in
	Atlanta, Clara Bingham in Washington, Peter Annin in Houston,
	Lucille Beachy in New York, Jeanne Gordon in Los Angeles, 
	Shawn D. Lewis in Detroit, Elizabeth Roberts in Miami, Debra
	Rosenberg in Boston and bureau reports

1st column	1st paragraph
They don't sell flowers out in the Sandpile.  So one day Pfc. John
Duggan, 24, a United States Marine who worked as a nightclub bouncer
before turning his attention to Saddam Hussein, picked some dry weeks
and mailed them to his fiancee.  "These are my roses," he wrote her.
AND HE SENT THEM WITH HIS LOVE.

2nd paragraph
In the Sandpile, it is always summer.  So as fall spread across
America, the father of Cmdr. Sue Carroll, a Navy nurse, cut some
autumn leaves and sent them to her in Saudi Arabia.  She hung them up
in her tent.  NOW, EACH TIME SHE LOOKS AT THEM, SHE SAYS, THEY REMIND
HER "THAT SOMEWHERE BACK THERE IS A PLACE WHERE THEY LEAD NORMAL
LIVES- AND LOVE ME."

3rd paragaph
In millions of letters home, soldiers are writing a foxhole chronicle
of America's showdown with Iraq.  Even though no one is shooting yet,
the mail is full of war stories:  the "Kiss 'em goodbye" alert
stateside, the barf-bag trip to the gulf, the heat, the flies, the
dead camels beyond the defense perimeter, scorpions big as field
mmice, sand vipers slithering through the dunes.  Each day you dig in
deeper, waiting for the balloon to go up.  AT NIGHT, BY FLASHLIGHT,
YOU PULL OUT YOUR BALLPOINT- AND WISH TO HELL YOU WERE HOME.

pg. 27
Title:  In Peril on the Sea

1st column	1st paragraph
Tyrone M. Brooks, 19, of Detroit, Mich., died Oct. 30 in a boiler
accident aboard the USS Iwo Jima.  From a letter to his fiancee,
Juanita Smith:

2nd paragraph
I am jsut fine.  I miss you and the baby a lot.  I WISH I COULD BE
THERE TO HOLD BOTH YOU AND HER OR HIM.  Did I tell you we have gone
halfway around the world?  I talked to my division officer the other
day, and he said if we are back before you have the baby he will make
sure that I am home for the birth of our child.  YOU KNOW HOW HE KNOWS
I AM HAVING A CHILD IS THAT HE SAW YOU WHEN YOU CAME ABOARD THE SHIP.
Have you talked to my mother since the last time you wrote?  If not,
you better call her so she can know how her daughter-in-law and
grandbaby are doing.  If I am not home when you go into labor, call so
my brother can come to the hospital.  Have you picked out a baby bed
yet?  Are you going to have a baby shower so all your friends can buy
my baby all those nice gifts?  If you need the money to have one, just
tell me how much and when to send it.  WELL, I HAVE TO GO NOW BUT
REMEMBER I LOVE YOU AND THE BABY.  Write me back as soon as you get
this letter.  Let's see if we can keep a steady flow of mail to each
other.  That's all.  P.S. I will buy the baby what you pick out when I
get home.

Title:  To Sir, With Love

1st column	2nd paragraph
Right now we are living near an oasis.  There is a small deserted
village here and it's over 300 years old.  Camels, wild dogs and goats
come t drink water from the well and eat the dates that fall from the
trees.  EVEN THOUGH OUR SOLDIERS AND PILOTS, MEN AND WOMEN, TRAIN VERY
HARD TO GO TO WAR, ALL OF US HERE DON'T WANT THAT TO HAPPEN.  War is
not what you see at the movies; it's ugly and painful.  We're here to
protect other people [and] because this part of the world is very
important to our economy and businesses.  Hopefully, our actions will
make a difference.

bottom of pg. 28	1st column	1st paragraph
The grunts now on alert in the gulf are members of a volunteer army,
not draftees like those who served at the peak of the Vietnam War.
When orders were cut for the gulf, the first impulse of most of them
was gung ho.  "Remember this," Preston Coffer, 24, a Marine corporal,
wrote to friends in Texas.  "We are talking about Marines, not the Boy
Scouts.  WE ALL JOINED THE SERVICE KNOWING FULL WELL WHAT MIGHT BE
EXPECTED OF US."  And he signed off "Semper Fi."  Others felt similar
pangs.  Adrian Ingraham, 20, paratrooper in the 82nd Airborne, was the
youngest of three Ingraham sons ordered to the Middle East.  "Momma,
Daddy, we all have jobs to do," he wrote home.  He told them not to
ask the Army to reassign him if Oswald, 34, or Irwin, 22, is killed.
Then he headed out.  "If something should happen to me," he wrote, "my
will is in my wall locker at Fort Bragg.  Room 211.  I didn't have
time to send it home."

2nd column	1st paragraph
FEW EXPECTED TO FACE SUCH A DANGEROUS MISSION QUITE SO ABRUPTLY.  FOR
MARINE CPL. CRAIG ARMSTRONG, 22, THE REALITY SANK IN WHEN HE HAD TO FOLLOW
REGULATIONS AND SEND HIS WEDDING RING TO HIS NEXT OF KIN.  "If felt as
if my ring finger was naked," he wrote his wife, Christie.  "Every
time I try to feel it or look down and it's not there, I just think
about you."

3rd column	1st paragraph
Some troops flew, sitting on equipment crammed into transports, others
went by sea, packed like sardines.  NO MATTER HOW THEY GOT THERE, THEY
KNEW THE SANDPILE WAS WAITING THERE FOR THEM.  Cpl. Edward Gregoire,
19, a Marine who came from Hawaii, wrote to his parents saying, "Hey
the Persian Gulf sounds nasty, but it's beautiful, too.  Crystal clear
water.  Dolphins following the boat."  Returning from a flight, Gary
Porterfield, 28, an Air Force pilot wrote: "It's nothing but sand.
One big beach.  I CAN'T BELIEVE PEOPLE ACTUALLY LIVE HERE."  The place
had a way of bringing out the Omar Khayyam in the most prosaic grunt.
"You should see the night," Army Sp/4 Larry Campbell wrote his wife,
Barbar.  "The sky comes alive with a billion stars and a moon that
seems s bright as a spotlight.  It's like you can see the whole
galaxy."  

pg.29		1st column	3rd paragraph
The banter made everyone feel better in the early phases of the
military buildup; but as the psy-war in the gulf threated to become
the real thing, the mood changed.  David Martin, 19, of the 101
Airborne, wrote his sister Kelley that he and his buddy, Ray were the
two forward-most Americans at the front:  nothing but Saudis ahead of
them.  Mail arrived every three days, by truck and by chopper.  AS
TIME PASSED, DAVID TOLD KELLEY, HE BEGAN TO FEEL "A SENSE OF MOMENTUM
TOWARD A CLASH....LOTS OF MOVEMENT, LOTS OF EQUIPMENT."  He was an
easygoing guy- he wrote his letters on Garfield the Cat stationery
imprinted, "If life is a bridge to be crossed, let's dawdle all we
can" - but he confessed to his sister that he got "more and more
nervous every day."

4th paragraph to top of 2nd column
Others felt the same way.  Herbert Plummer, 21, a paratrooper, wrote
his mother to say that some nights he couldn't sleep "because of my
fear of this place."  HE DIDN'T KNOW WHY, BUT "BEEING IN THIS COUNTRY
MAKES ME SO JUMPY I CAN ALMOST FEEL AS IF SOMEONE IS WATCHING ME.  No
lie!"  At other outposts, dead camels beyond the defense perimeters
made the desert stink.  A fire incinerated one unit's mailroom.
Nerves tautened.  Even friends grew edgy.  Then, each evening just
after dark, Baghdad Betty, Saddam Hussein's answer to Tokyo Rose, got
on the radio to work on them.  "She tells us we're going to die and
Iraqi worms are going to eat us," Army Sgt. Eric Petersen reported to
his wife, Maryann.  "Pretty awful, huh?"

3rd column	1st paragraph
Coming off a routine watch on day, Michael N. (Chip) Manns, Jr., 23, a
machinist's mate third class aboard the USS Iwo Jima, wrote his father
about te frustrations aboard a ship jammed with sailors:  "men in my
workspace, men in the chowline, men in the showers, men all around
when I'm sleeping, men, men, men."  He told his mother he stood eight
hours of watch a day, worked eight, then slept four to six hours each
night in the jammed quarters.  "Everything is pretty routine," he
wrote.  "Actually, being over here doesn't bother me that much.  It's
just the waiting.  IF WE ARE GOING TO WAR, I WISH WE COULD GET THE
SHOW ON THE ROAD."  Two weeks later a steam pipe on the Iwo Jima
ruptured.  The blast killed Chip Manns.

2nd paragraph to bottom of pg. 30
Somewhere south of Kuwait, the Third Battalion of the 11th Marines is
dug into desert trenches, its 155-mm howitzers ready to deliver
supporting fire for a tank assault or amphibious invasion.  At sunup,
Marines crowd around the tailgate of a truck for mail call.  In the
heat and dust of the outpost, letters become tattered and stained.
Capt. Jerry Sneed carries in his pocket a creased sheet from his son.
It has a drawing of the Marine Corps War Memorial- the flag raising on
Iwo Jima- and the words "To Dad.  You make me proud Dad.  Jeremy."
OFF TO THE SIDE, PFC. JOHN DUGGAN HOPES FOR WORD FROM HIS FIANCEE
KATHRYN REDMAN.  They were engaged three days before he was sent to
Saudi Arabia.  "I'M IN LOVE, I CAN'T THINK ABOUT ANYTHING ELSE," HE
SAYS.  "I FEEL TOTALLY EMPTY.  I live in a hole in the ground and the
only thing that helps me to pass the time is her letters," he syas.
He writes her constantly.  One time he pulled some hair off his chest
and sent it to her.  She sent him back a strand of her hair.  Then he
sent her those desert weeds and an impassioned audiotape.  "It was
like he was right here," she says.  "At the end of the tape I was
hugging the speaker next to me."

bottom of pg. 30	2nd column	1st paragraph
About 85 percent of Major Vaughn's letters and packages are addressed
to individuals.  He gives those marked "To any service personnel" to
people who get nothing from home.  It is not uncommon to find a
battle-hardened Viet vet like Massengill carrying on earnest
correspondence with 7- and 8-year-old kids and dusty grunts laughing
over lines from tiny pen pals like "If you guys can't end it, then my
Dad might have to come."  Kids not much younger than Pfc. Hosi
Johnson, 19, of the 101st Airborne, who was in high school in Chicago
only a year ago write to ask if he feels scared.  HE TELLS THEM, "YES,
IT'S ALWAYS AT THE BACK OF MY MIND.  I TOLD ONE KID THAT I JOINED THE
ARMY TO PAY MY WAY THROUGH SCHOOL AND I SAID IMIGHT NOT MAKE IT
THROUGH- BUT I TELL THEM I LIVE IN HOPE."

3rd column	1st paragraph
Mail alone cannot neutralize the Vietnam syndrome, but it helps.
Marine Staff Sgt. William Fitgerald, 30, was too young for Vietnam.
When he joined the corps 11 years ago, he heard Viet vets telling
horror stories all the time.  "They'd get letters from home, sure," he
says.  "But the media, the war protesters, even some of the
politicians were telling them they were doing the wrong thing, they
were murderers, they were on their own."  Now he gets letters from a
nun in Philadelphia who had eight brothers in World War II.  "SHE TOLD
ME SHE WAS PROUD OF WHAT WE WERE DOING, AND CARED FOR US AND- WITH A
NAME LIKE FITGERALD, TO SAY A ROSARY IF I WAS CATHOLIC."  He heard his
son say "Papa" for the first time when his wife, Carole, sent him an
audiotape.  Determined that the American soldier won't be forgotten
this time, she has distributed 2,000 aluminum bracelets marked "1990-
"Til our Fighting Forces Return."  SHE HAS ALSO WRITTEN TO PRESIDENT
BUSH, SAYING, "WE WANT PEOPLE TO REMEMBER WHEN THEY START COMPLAINING
ABOUT THE PRICE OF GAS TO THINK OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE PUTTING THEIR
LIVES ON THE LINE."

2nd paragraph
THAT INCLUDES WOMEN, WHO SHARE THE ALTERNATING CURRENTS OF BOREDOM AND
PAIN THAT NOW COURSE THROUGH DAILY LIFE IN THE GULF.  At the U.S.
Navy's Fleet Hospital Five in Jubail, where tents with 500 beds,
intensive care and X-ray units are pitched ready for casualties, Lt.
Carla Tolbert says, "Life gets strange here- something like a prison,
something like a girl's school."  

pg. 32		1st column	1st paragraph
The mail is a bridge, however rickety, between duty and love.  Out on
the line, Marine Lance Cpl. Frank Gudmundson, 22, a fire team leader
whoo will see sharp fighting if war breaks out, logs his letters and
thoughts in a journal.  He has entitled his little notebook "Total
(1990) Recall."  "My mind and my heart belong at home with my wife,
but my ass belongs to the Marine Corps," he writes in one passage.
The next sentence is "I will stand by patiently for mail call."  When
his mother sent a photo of him and his brothers as little kids, he
wrote in his diary, "It seems like yesterday we were out playing army
with our plastic machine guns, building bunkers out of hay bales and
counting to fifty when we had gotten shot.  Now it's the real thing
today.  AND I DON'T THINK COUNTING TO FIFTY WILL BRING US BACK ALIVE."

3rd paragraph
Something about these letters in the sand subverts the conventional
wisdom about what is at risk in the gulf.  Presidents and kings,
diplomats and generals speak the language of geopolitics and global
economics.  To them, the flow of oil is more important than the flow
of mail.  After listening to so much martial rhetoric from the top, it
is a relief to read things like, "Hello, Devil Dog Family," the
salutaton of a dusty Marine.  You worry about what could happen to
these pen pals if war does come, and very little that the top dogs
have to say helps much.  "I WISH I COULD HELP," WRITES SALOME
WELLIVER, A FOURTH GRADER FROM KANSAS CITY.  "But I'm just a
nine-year-old.  I pray for you and peace.  If war starts you can win.
God bless you."  Every one of you.

Title:  `Somebody in Saudi Arabia Loves Me'
Subheader:  THE FAMILIES LEFT BEHIND STRUGGLE TO FILL THE VOID
By:  Barbara Kantrowitz

3rd column	1st paragraph
This fall, Fort Campbell is nearly empty.  By last week, 19,000
soldiers- the entire division plus support units- had shipped out to
Saudi Arabia, part of America's largest military deployment since
Vietnam.  In August and September, Ferguson and her husband sat in
their backyard, listening to "a constant soft roar of the planes," she
says.  "It never stopped.  EACH ONE WOULD TAKE OFF AND YOU WOULD
WONDER WHO WAS ON IT.  They'd take off, make that turn for the east
they'd be gone."

3rd paragraph to top of page 33
A few children waved goodbye to both parents.  Col. Ted Purdom left on
Sept. 24.  Amonth later, his wife, Lt. Col. Jean Purdom, shipped out.
Jean's mother Frances McKenna, came from Massachusetts to look after
grandsons Matthew, 11, and T.J., 9.  They save their parent's letters.
In one, dated Oct. 24, Ted Purdom wrote:  "Matt, I think of you each
day and I wear your acolyte cross all the time.  I JUST LOVE IT AND
KNOW IT PROTECTS ME."  ALTHOUGH THE ARMY HAS PUT NO TIME LIMITS ON
TOURS OF DUTY, T.J. BELIEVES HIS PARENTS WILL BE AWAY FOR SIX MONTHS:
"FIVE MORE MONTHS FOR MY MOM AND FOUR MORE MONTHS FOR MY DAD."  When
they return, "Me and Dad are going to go hunting and fishing.  My mom,
I'm going to save up money to buy her something.  Maybe a hair dryer."

top of pg. 33		1st column	1st paragraph
YEARS AGO THE ARMY DIDN'T WORRY TOO MUCH ABOUT THE PROBLEMS OF SPOUSES
AND CHILDREN ON THE HOME FRONT.  THERE'S AN OLD SAYING:  IF THE ARMY
WANTED YOU TO HAVE A WIFE, IT WOULD HAVE ISSUED YOU ONE.  That
attitude is a luxury the all-volunteer Army can no longer afford.
Attracting career soldiers means provodomg for their families as well.
At Fort Campbell, there are seven schools for 4,000 students from the
elementary grades through high school, a childcare center, financial
and emotional counseling services- even a woodworking class to teach
wives how to make home repairs while their husbands are away.

2nd column	1st paragraph
HANDLING THESE FAMILLY TENSIONS REQUIRES SOME INGENUITY.  Carolyn
Dove, principal of the Wassom Middle School, received a particularly
heartbreaking letter from a single parent, Staff Sgt. Leila Jordan,
who was distraught because she had not heard from her children,
Christopher, 13, and Daniel, 3.  Jordan signed the letter:  "Parent
always.  Even so far away."  The children were healthy (an aunt was
looking after them); the problem was unreliable mail service in the
early days.  BUT DOVE, MOVED BY THE LETTER, DECIDED TO MAKE SURE
JORDAN AND HER CHILDREN KEPT IN TOUCH.  Twice a week, Christopher
comes to her office and, under her supervision, writes to his mother.

3rd column	3rd paragraph
UNDER STRESS:  And always, there is the fear of hearing the worst
possible news.  The Army has procedures for notifying next of kin
(NOK, military parlance).  but under stress, it's easy to panic.  LAST
WEEK, ONE FORT CAMPBELL WIFE, VISITING RELATIVES IN ILLINOIS, RECEIVED
WHAT SHE THOUGHT WAS OFFICIAL WORD THAT HER HUSBAND HAD BEEN SHOT AND
WAS ON HIS WAY TO WALTER REED ARMY HOSPITAL IN WASHINGTON, D.C.  She
immediately flew to Washington, but no one at the hospital had any
information about her husband.  Finally, Army officials in Kentucky
checked with the troops in Saudi Arabia.  Her husband was fine; the
call had been a sick joke by an unknown prankster.

4th paragraph
AS THE WEEKS PASS, MOST OF THE FAMILIES HAVE TRIED TO ESTABLISH A
ROUTINE THAT BLOCKS OUT THOUGHTS OF THE DESERT.  But it isn't easy.
With the threat of war so close, even routine occasions take on added
significance.  Last week the students at Mahaffey Middle School made
patriotism the theme of their fall concert.  Most of the students wore
red, white and blue clothes to school.  The few that didn't had T
shirts or sweat shirts with special messages.  One girl's read:
"Someone in Saudi Arabia loves me."  Any one of them could have worn
it; virtually all have at least one parent in the gulf.  The concert
concluded with "America the Beautiful" -all three verses.  The
school's slide projector flashed the lyrics on a screen so the
audience could sing along.  But in this crowd, there was no need.
Everyone already knew the words.

Bottom of pg. 33	1st column	1st paragraph
Marine Cpl. Craig Armstrong of Carthage. N.C. drew gulf duty while on
a routine deployment to Okinawa.  From shipboard he wrote his wife,
Cris:

2nd paragraph
So how are you doing with all this Saudi Arabia s--- that is in the
papers and on the news every day?  DON'T BELIEVE HALF OF THE THINGS
THEY SAY.  Because it is opinions and speculation.  It's just a bunch
of politicians that don't know what they are talking about.  So don't
even worry about it.

3rd paragraph
We really have not been doing much.  We have got a new little game we
play now.  We wear our gas masks everywhere we go.  So someone can
simulate a gas attack.  And we will wear them until the CO says "all
clear."  I'm just waiting to see what games we will play next.

4th paragraph
I've started to notice that everybody in the platoon is [getting]
tighter with each other.  Most of them are starting to get the point
that this is serious, and not just another Panama invasion.  Where we
are heading now is for real.

5th paragraph
I told you on the phone that you would be receiving my wedding ring
[pursuant to Marine Corps instructions to leave valuables with
family].  I sent it yesterday.  It felt real weird not having it on.
It felt as if my ring finger was naked.  I just think about you and
coming home.  The first thing you will do is slide my wedding band
back on my finger.
