As the Olympics draw near, avalanches sound a
warning of environmental damage in the Alps

BY CHRISTOPHER DICKEY

The French Alps offered a holi-
day weekend from hell just days 
before Christmas.  For 24 miser-
able hours, cars backed 
up- and piled up- in scle-
rotic masses clogging the narrow 
mountain valleys.  Trains, too, failed 
to move.  Avalanches thundered, 
killing one person and injuring 
more than a dozen others and seri-
ously damaging a small hotel at Val 
d'Isere.  Thousands of hapless mer-
rymakers were forced to sleep on cots far 
from their pricey, unreachable rooms at 
some of the Alps' most famous ski resorts.

The source of the problem- a heavy 
snowfall- could not have been more 
~predictable~.  The implications of the pre-
Christmas chaos could hardly be more seri-
ous:  these same jammed roads and rum-
bling mountainsides around Albertville in 
Savoy will be the site of the 1992 Winter 
Olympics, due to start Feb. 8.  If regional 
officials aren't better prepared by then, de-
clared Andre Baudin, mayor of nearby 
Tignes, "I strongly advise them to postpone 
the sporting events until July."

Although snow shouldn't come as 
a ~surprise~ in the Alps, it caught 
many French unprepared, not least 
those stranded in their cars.  For 
a handful of environmental activ-
ists, however, the ~prospect~ of calam-
ity was no shock.  For years they 
warned that Savoy is saturat-
ed with ~ill-conceived~ ski resorts 
that threaten the Alps' delicate balance of 
man and mountain.

With a permanent population of only 
340,000, Savoy has built accommodations 
for another 340,000 visitors over the last 
few decades.  Mountain villages where only 
a few hundred people live year-round may 
see their numbers swell twentyfold during 
the winter season.  For the Olympics 1,500 
athletes, 7,000 journalists and a million
spectators are ~expected~.

The environmental impact of such 
an influx is sometimes ~obvious~, some-
times insidious. Traffic jams crowd moun-
tain roads. Sewer systems overflow into 
streams. Beneath the winter snows there is 
bare rock where once trees and grass held 
topsoil in place. As one environmentalist
puts it, "The ski runs used to follow the
contours of the land. Now they remodel
the mountain." Under pressure to increase
the number of runs, developers have ex-
tended them into areas threatened by ava-
lanches, building new barriers on the
mountainsides to fend offslides and install-
ing explosive devices for pre-emptive
strikes on accumulating snow. "If you ski in
a forest, over the long term, you condemn
the forest," says Rene Pinck, a high-school
shop teacher from near the resort of Meri-
bel. "For 18 years I've lived here, and for 18
years the building has never stopped. "

When the winter-sports boom started to
wane in the 1980s, ecologists ~hoped~ the 
mountains might have a respite. Then, with
heavy lobbying from former ski star Jean-
Claude Killy and French National Assem-
bly member Michel Barnier, Albertville
won the Winter Olympics. A new boom was
~predicted~, and new construction began.
But, as Barnier concedes, "the problems
were a lot greater than we ~anticipated~."

"The problem is not the facilities them-
selves, but everything that is done around
them," says Monique Gautier, a biology
professor and environmentalist in Cham-
bery. She cites a new resort being rushed to
completion on what was once a scenic little
road between Meribel and Courchevel.
Nearby, 12 acres of forest have been felled
and the mountain face amended with vast
parking lots to accommodate the Olympic
ski jump and ~expected~ crowds.

For new hotels and facilities to be profit-
able, more tourists will be needed over a
longer season. To keep the slopes ski-wor-
thy, batteries of snow-making cannons
have multiplied on the mountainsides,
with little or no study of their environ-
mental impact. Golf courses built for the
summer crowds require pesticides and her-
bicides. And pressure is growing to allow
more glacier skiing in the region's protect-
ed national parks. "They build the hotels
for the Olympic Games," says Gautier,
"and then to keep them filled, they propose
summer skiing."

Long-term benefits: Olympic promoters Kil-
ly and Barnier argue that every possible
step has been taken to minimize ecological
damage, and the money invested in infra-
structure will net long-term environmen-
tal benefits. For the Games, 24-hour road-
clearing operations and 1,000 police will
be in place to avoid the kind of bottlenecks
that tied up the region before Christmas.
Even the Games' harshest critics concede
that roads and water-treatment facili-
ties have been improved dramatically.

"Savoy as an ecosystem is very fragile,"
Barnier is quick to say. But until well into
this century, he notes, Savoy as an econo-
my was also very poor. Farmers, whose
dairy cattle are an integral part of tradi-
tional Alpine ecology, were deserting the
land. Now income from the seasonal em-
ployment on the ski slopes allows many
locals to stay. "These resorts, objectively
speaking, have saved the region," says Bar-
nier. But some of the installations required
for the Games are such potential white
elephants- financially as well as ecologi-
cally- that even Barnier ~finds~ them diffi-
cult to defend. The most conspicuous sym-
bol of excess is what Pinck calls "that great
snake of concrete," the bobsled run at La
Plagne. Built on unstable ground in an
avalanche zone (one killed a man before
Christmas), it is cooled with 45 tons of vola-
tile ammonia. The final cost- $42 mil-
lion- is three times the original estimate.

Yet for all this, most Savoyards seem
happy the Olympics are coming. "They're
~proud~," Gautier concedes. Activists look on
more with despair than anger. Pinck, who
lives just minutes from the ice-hockey stadi-
um and the ski jump, says he doesn't ~plan~ to
attend any of the events. "I ~hope~ to go to In-
dia," he says, "for a little birdwatching."
