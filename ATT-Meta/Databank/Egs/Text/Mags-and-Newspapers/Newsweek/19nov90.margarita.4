Title:  From Peaks to Valleys
Subheader:  DOES ANYONE STILL CARE WHO KILLED LAURA PALMER?
By:  Joshua Hammer

1st column	1st paragraph
BY THE TIME YOU READ THIS YOU'LL PROBABLY KNOW THE ENDING TO
TELEVISION'S BIGGEST MYSTERY SINCE J. R. EWING NEARLY GOT BUMPED OFF
IN "DALLAS" BACK IN 1980.  The question is- will you care?  LONG
BEFORE THE MUCH-HYPED DENOUEMENT OF ABC'S "TWIN PEAKS" FINALLY AIRED
LAST SATURDAY NIGHT, ENTHUSIASM FOR THE QUIRKY SERIES HAD GROWN COLDER
THA A DAY-OLD CUP OF JOE.  Just ask "Twin Peaks" fan David Jefferson.
A Wall Street Journal reporter in Los Angeles, Jefferson decided to
organize a "Who Killed Laura Palmer?" party on Nov. 10 and posted a
sign-up sheet on his office bulletin board.  "I HAD VISIONS OF GETTING
A SECOND TV BECAUSE MY APARTMENT WOULD BE BULGING AT THE SEAMS WITH
PEOPLE," HE SAYS.  Jefferson took down the sheet four days later-
after attracting just one signature.  "I'm a latecomer to this show,"
sighs Jefferson.  "Now I'm being deserted.  Nobody wants to come to my
party."

2nd column	2nd paragraph to top of 3rd column
But other experts say that ABC goofed by burying its best shows on a
dead night.  "When you put 'China Beach' and 'Twin Peaks' on Saturday,
you're saying these two shows have no ability to grow," says David
Poltrack, CBS's senior vice president for research and planning.
Indeed, both shows are losing members of the young audience they might
attract on a weeknight.  Cleve Keller, a 22-year-old Manhattan
publicist, avidly watched "Twin Peaks" with eight friends every
Thursday last spring.  "We ate doughnuts- and we adapted the show's
dialogue into our daily speech, saying things like 'damn fine cup o'
coffee'," she says.  "BUT NOBODY'S HOME SATURDAY NIGHT, AND WE'VE ALL
PUT THE SHOW OUT OF OUR MINDS."

3rd column	1st paragraph
Some viewers say they're frustrated by the show's creative drift.
TRACY HARSHMAN OF YOUNGSTOWN, OHIO, GOT FED UP WITH THE KNOTTY PLOT
AND THE WRITERS STUBBORN REFUSAL TO RESOLVE ITS MANY MYSTERIES.  "Each
week they do wonderfully creative things, but they go in a million
directions," she complains.  AFTER MISSING A COUPLE OF EARLY
ESPISODES, BILL BOWMAN, A LAWYER FROM CHEVY CHASE, MD., SAYS HE "FOUND
MYSELF HELPLESSLY CONFUSED AND WONDERING WHY NOBODY ON THE SHOW SEEMS
TO CARE WHO KILLED LAURA PALMER ANYMORE."  Others say they're tired of
creator David Lynch's weirdness for weirdness's sake- the
intergalactic telegrams, the giant night visitors, the
orchid-cultivating keeper of Laura Palmer's diary.  SAYS NEW YORK
ATTORNEY FRANZ PAASCHE:  "THERE IS THIS UNCOMFORTABLE SENSE THAT THE
WHOLE SHOW IS A JOKE ON THE VIEWER."

2nd paragraph
Can "Twin Peaks" survive?  Well, somebody pushed Pocket Books' "The
Secret Diary of Laura Palmer" to fifth place on The New York Times's
trade-paperback best-seller list.  CULTISTS STILL DEBATE "PEAKS"
ESOTERICA, PONDERING, FOR INSTANCE, WHETHER A MYSTERIOUS NEW JAPANESE
CHARACTER IS REALLY CATHERINE MARTELL IN DISGUISE.  MARK FROST,
COCREATOR OF THE SHOW, SAYS THAT HE'S "DISAPPOINTED" BY THE POOR
RATINGS, BUT INSISTS THAT ABC HAS PROMISED TO MOVE THE SHOW TO A
WEEKNIGHT "IF IT ISN'T WORKING."  Others don't see how the show can
last.  "I think ABC would really like this show to die," says Kitman.
ABC insists it's on the right track, and has even begun exploiting its
strategy in its promotions.  One spot shows nervous ABC executives
being chewed out by their boss for scheduling "the best shows on TV"
on Saturday night.  The tag line urges viewers to watch the programs
and "save our jobs."  If "Twin Peaks" ratings don't improve soon, they
may have a real reason to worry.

Title:  The Wonder Boom Years
Subheader:  A MUSEUM EXAMINES POSTNUCLEAR CHILDHOOD
By:  Katrine Ames with Daniel Glick in Washington

1st column	1st paragraph
Money.  Television.  The bomb.  Seperately, any would have altered a
generation.  Together, the unholy trinity conspired to make the
childhood of 76 million Americans born between 1946 and 1964 from any
that proceded it.  In a booming postwar economy, the growing middle
class suddenly had disposable income- and they often disposed of it on
their offspring.  In the first decade after World War II, the toy
business nearly tripled; by the late '50s it was a billion-dollar
industry.  Electronic marketing arrived on a large scale, aimed at a
particularly receptive audience:  kids hooked on such commercial-laced
elixers as "Howdy Doody" and "leave It to Beaver."  BUT ABOVE (OR
BENEATH) THIS PPARENT IDYLL WHERE FATHER ALWAYS KNEW BEST, THERE WAS
THE THREAT OF ARMAGEDDON.  At any minute, you, the Beave and your Davy
Crockett hat might be vaporized by atomic weapons unleashed by
communists.  AT THE NATIONAL MUSEUM OF AMERICAN HISTORY IN WASHINGTON,
A NEW EXHIBITION, "THIS IS YOUR CHILDHOOD, CHARLIE BROWN:  CHILDREN
AND AMERICAN CULTURE, 1945-1968," EXAMINES GROWING UP IN THE ENIGMATIC
EARLY DAYS OF THE NUCLEAR AGE.

2nd column	1st paragraph
FREUD NEVER ASKED, "WHAT DOES A CHID WANT?"  BUT IN THE 44 YEARS SINCE
BENJAMIN SPOCK PUBLISHED "THE COMMON SENSE BOOK OF BABY AND CHILD
CARE," MILLIONS OF AMERICANS HAVE BEEN NEARLY OBSESSED WITH THE
QUESTION.  With changing social climates, they keep coming up with
different answers.  IN THE "TOGETHERNESS PERIOD THE MUSEUM SHOW
FOCUSES ON, WHAT KIDS WANTED- MORE ACCURATELY, WHAT THEIR PARENTS,
TELEVISION PROGRAMMERS AND OTHERS WANTED THEM TO WANT- WAS CHEERFUL
CONFORMITY AND UNQUESTIONING OBEDIENCE.  What the exhibit (which runs
until April 30) best illustrates is that during the Wonder Bread
years, there was plenty of burnt toast.

3rd column	4th paragraph
WHAT'S ASTONISHING IS HOW PERSPICACIOUS THOSE STRIPS WERE- EVEN TO
SCHULZ, WHO DOES NOT CONSIDER HIMSELF A SOCIAL CRITIC.  AFTER
RE-EXAMINING HIS EARLY WORK, THE CARTOONIST SAID TO CURATOR MCGOVER,
"IT'S ALL THERE, ISN'T IT?"  Nor did McGovern have to stretch a point:
"For every one we picked there were four others that could have taken
its place, " he says.

6th paragraph
The post-nuke generation may not have invented nostalgia, but it did
turn it into a lifestyle.  While still in their teens, the first of
the baby boomers discovered the '30s and early '40s, particularly the
period's movies, and romanticized the era that gave us Hitler,
Mussolini and global economic depression.  Not to mention Spam.  Now
the boomers are romanticizing their own past, paying huge sums for the
tattered totems of their own childhood.  (McGovern even had some
difficulty assembling the Smithsonian show because collectors have
hoarded so many items.)  The exhibition let some light in on the dark
side of childhood, but McGovern cautions against turning "Peanuts"
into a metaphor.  "This is a comic strip," he says.  "It's not a guide
to life.  SHULZ IS A CHRONICLER, AND FOR THIS PERIOD OF TIME, HE WAS
TAPPED INTO THE GREATER CURRENTS."

Title:  Sitting on the Dock of the Bay
Subheader:  THE BOYS OF BLUBBER RETURN TO A SAN FRANCISCO PIER
By:  David A. Kaplan with Nadine Joseph on Pier 39

1st column	3rd paragraph
Now the whiskered fellows are back, hauled up on the K-Dock as if they
never were away.  "AS FAR AS THE SEA LIONS ARE CONCERNED," SAYS FRITZ
ARKO, PRESIDENT OF PIER 39, "THIS IS HOME."  Arko can barely make
himself heard, as he proudly points to the pungent pinnipeds carrying
on just 50 feet below beyond a lock gate.  They're constantly barking
and yelping as they shove one another off the dock in an aquatic
version of King of the Hill.  The clever ones try sneak attacks by
swimming under the the dock to blindside the bigger players; they
usually get pummeled.  "It's more exciting than an aquarium," says
8-year-old Neal Burgner, visiting his mother.

2nd column	2nd paragraph
EXPERTS WORRY THAT THE SEA OF YOSEMITE:  TOO USED TO PEOPLE AND TOO
LAZY TO HUNT FOR FOOD.  "They're slugs," says Brian Gibeson, a Bay
Area marine biologist.  "They'd do anything for fish and Pier 39 is
the ultimate deli."  But whether they stick around or return to their
natural migratory habits along the Pacific coast, the sea lions have
been immortalized in a truly San Franciscan way.  Intrigued by their
sounds, composer Doug McKechnie recorded the best barks of the bay and
used computer technology to produce a song that would make Tony Bennet
envious.  Soon playing at a wharf near you:  "I Left My Arf in San
Francisco."

Title:  Made in Japan:  Better Baseball
By:  Bill Powell in Tokyo

3rd column	2nd paragraph
THE JAPANESE ALL-STARS SWEPT THE FIRST FOUR GAMES OF LAST WEEK'S
"EXHIBITION" SERIES WHICH, IN JAPAN, WAS CALLED THE "SUPER MAJOR
SERIES" AND WAS TELEVISED LIVE, NATIONWIDE, EVERY DAY, WHICH MIGHT
GIVE YOU A HINT ABOUT WHO THOUGHT IT WAS AN "EXHIBITION" AND WHO
DIDN'T.  And, as the saying goes, the Japanese made it look easy, in
part because the U.S. players dozed at the plate and committed four
errors a game.  Finally, in the fifth game, they came from behind to
win one.  But the Japanese clinched the series the next day in a way
that must have seemed inscrutable to the U.S. side:  the teams played
to a 6-6 draw (in Japan games can end in ties), guaranteeing that
Japan would win the overall series for only the second time since its
inception in 1908.

4th paragraph
Commissioner Vincent finally conceded that the series was "an
embarrassment."  In Japan, one sportswriter wrote politely that the
American's couldn't possibly be trying.  A TV ANALYST SAID THAT THE
JAPANESE IMPROVED, SHOWING THE AMERICANS THAT THEY COULD NO LONGER
ASSUME VICTORY.  Still, one American banker now working in Japan was
inconsolable.   "We're no even No. 1 in baseball anymore," he wailed.
"What's left?"

Title:  Bad Times at Hangover U.
Subheader:  COLLEGE PARTIES LEAD TO THE ER OR THE DRUNK TANK
By:  Debra Rosenberg in Boston

1st column	1st paragraph
Marty woke up at 5 a.m. when the nurse slapped him in the face.  It
had been a long night:  the party started with beer and graduated to
Russian vodka.  Marty downed shot after shot until he vomited on
someone's leg.  HE THINKS HE SPENT AN HOUR FACE DOWN IN THE MIDDLE OF
THE STREET.  THE AMBULANCE RIDE TO THE HOSPITAL WAS A BLUR, TOO.  IN
FACT, MARTY'S ONLY VIVID MEMORY OF HIS 18TH BIRTHDAY IS THE MORNING
AFTER.  "Hangovers are not fun," says the Harvard freshman.

2nd column	1st paragraph
Alcohol consumption is down throughout the country, but "this news has
not reached the college campuses yet," says Dr. Henry Wechsler, a
professor at Harvard School of Public Health.  HE SURVEYED THE
DRINKING HABITS OF 1,600 FRESHMEN AT 14 MASSACHUSETTS COLLEGES AND
FOUND THAT AMONG THOSE WHO DRINK AT LEAST ONCE A WEEK, 92 PERCENT OF
THE MEN AND 82 PERCENT OF THE WOMENT CONSUME AT LEAST FIVE DRINKS IN A
ROW.  FULLY HALF SAID THEY WANTED TO GET DRUNK.

3rd column	1st paragraph
Some officials blame the return to the 21-year-old minimum drinking
age.  Students have been forced to move their parties off campus where
they lap up dangerous spiked punches rather than beer.  "WE WANT TO
TRY TO BRING THE PROBLEMS BACK ON CAMPUS WHERE OUR STAFF CAN MONITOR
THEM," SAYS ROBERT SHERWOOD, BOSTON COLLEGE'S DEAN FOR STUDENT
DEVELOPMENT, WHOO SUPPORTS A RETURN TO THE 18-YEAR-OLD MINIMUM.

3rd paragraph
The alcohol problem on campus remains so widespread that 56 colleges
met last week at Harvard University to discuss strategies for more
aggressive education and counseling programs.  BUT COLLEGES REALLY
HAVE LITTLE IDEA WHAT WILL WORK.  Some have even resorted to a once
unimaginabl option- having students arrested for minor offenses.
Harsh perhaps, but preferable to waiting for one of the partygoers to
end up in the morgue.

Title:  The Voters Speak:  Read Our Lips, If You Can

1st paragraph
WITH 45 EDUCATION INITIATIVES ON BALLOTS IN 24 STATES LAST WEEK, THE
PUBLIC HAD ITS BEST CHANCE THIS YEAR TO SPEAK ABOUT EDUCATION REFORM.
AND IT RESPONDED WITH A RESOUNDING MAYBE, SHOWING UNMISTAKABLE
SKEPTICISM ABOUT BOTH NEW REFORMS AND THE MORE CONVENTIONAL TACTIC OF
THROWING MORE MONEY AT THE PROBLEM.  Most of the balloting was heavily
influenced by state and local factors.  There was, says Michael Kirst,
a professor of education at Stanford University, "no backlash on
education."  But neither, says Frank Newman, president of the
Education Commission of the States, was there any "willingness to do
something radical."  Here is how several of the most significant
initiatives fared:

2nd column	1st paragraph
OREGON:  Voters handily defeated a referendum that would have granted
$2,500 in tax credits to families that choose to send their children
to private schools or educate them at home.  Opponents charged that
voucers would undermine the public-school system by draining off $95
million for children already attending private schools.  Nationally,
proponents viewed the Oregon measure as a litmus test for the
"parental choice" movement.  "THE PUBLIC KEEPS SAYING IT WANTS MORE
CHOICE," SAYS STANFORD'S KIRST.  "But not one of these propositions
has ever passed."  Oregonians also decided to put a cap on school
property-tax assessments.

3rd column 	3rd paragraph to top of 4th column
MASSACHUSETTS:  The voters rejected one of the most sweeping antitax
measure on any state ballot.  In Massachusetts, 40 percent of a school
district's budget comes from state aid.  "There's a kind of
conventional wisdom that any time you ask people to lower their taxes
they're going to say yes.  THE MESSAGE ACTUALLY GOT THROUGH THE VOTERS
THAT THIS PETITION THREATENED THEIR WELL-BEING," SAYS MARC LANDY, A
POLITICAL-SCIENCE PROFESSOR AT BOSTON COLLEGE.

4th column	1st paragraph
NEBRASKA:  Voters refused to repeal the state's seven-month-old
school-financing law that levies higher state sales and income taxes.
THE LAW IS MEANT TO CLOSE THE SPENDING GAP BETWEEN SCHOOLS IN
PROPERTY-RICH DISTRICTS AND THOSE IN POOR DISTRICTS BY IMPOSING
SPENDING LIMITS AND ROLLBACKS ON PROPERTY TAXES.

Title:  That'll Teach the Rascals
Subheader:  GOVERNMENT IN GRIDLOCK RARELY WORKS WELL BUT DOES
	REPRESENT THE PUBLIC MOOD

1st column	2nd paragraph
DEMOCRATS DID WELL ON TUESDAY BUT, AS THEY TURN TO THE TASK OF
UNHORSING GEORGE BUSH TWO NOVEMBERS FROM NOW, THEY SHOULD WORRY ABOUT
WRINGING LESSONS FROM THE ODD RESULTS.  A recurring theme was
resentment of taxes, so the more liberal party prospered in a
conservative season.

5th paragraph
ENTERING 1991 MANY DEMOCRATS WILL HAVE ONE IDEA:  SQUEEZE THE RICH
UNTIL THEY SQUEAK.  REPUBLICANS ARE HOPING THE DEMOCRATS WILL, AS IS
THEIR WONT, GO TOO FAR.  THE MORE DEMOCRATS CRY "TAX THE RICH!" THE
MORE DEMOCRATS ARE DEFINED BY THE WORD "TAX."  DEMOCRATS ARE HOPING
BUSH WILL RETURN TO HIS CRUSADE FOR CUTTING CAPITAL GAINS TAXES.  The
Democrats' can be a surtax on millionaires.  Then the issue will be
framed in their favor.

2nd column	1st paragraph
ANOTHER DANGER FOR DEMOCRATS IS THEIR DESIRE TO RESUSCITATE THE 1990
CIVIL-RIGHTS BILL THAT BUSH VETOED.  Democrats may also become defined
by another word, "quotas," just as the politics of race is becoming
more complex.  The Congressional Black Caucus now must grit its teeth
and accept the integration:  A conservative Republican is coming.
There goes the nieghborhood.

3rd paragraph
The president, too, has some dangerous defining to do, of himself.
When he was squished in the 1988 Iowa caucuses (he finished third
behind Bob Dole and Pat Robertson, with just 18.6 percent of the
votes) he put on a new person- the Mugger from Yale.  He derailed Dole
in New Hampshire with ads calling Dole "Senator Straddle" because Dole
was less than categorical in promising no new taxes.  Then Bush
rounded on Dukakis.  BUT, AS PRESIDENT, BUSH HAS WANTED TO GET ALONG
BY GOING ALONG WITH WASHINGTON'S DIFFERENCE-SPLITTING AND
IDEOLOGY-BLURRING POLITICAL BAZAAR.

4th paragraph
REMARKABLE SUCCESSES:  The third president in his first Inaugural
Address said, "We are all Republicans, we are all Federalists."  But
Jefferson actually practiced a fiercer partisanship than is seen
today.  (The Alien and Sedition Acts, passed just three years before
Jefferson proclaimed the end of partisanship, were framed by
Federalists to punish Republicans.)  THE 41ST PRESIDENTS SAID IN HIS
INAUGURAL ADDRESS THAT AMERICANS WANT WASHINGTON "TO RISE ABOVE THE
MERELY PARTISAN."  IF SO, THEY HAVE AN ODD WAY OF EXPRESSING THAT
WISH:  THEY GIVE DIFFERENT BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT TO DIFFERENT
PARTIES.

6th paragraph
California is a microcosm of the nation (not very micro: one in nine
citizens lives there), and its recent political history mirrors
America's mood.  CALIFORNIANS, SAYS PROF. CHARLES KESSLER, HAVE TWO
STRONG DESIRES THAT ARE PROVING TO BE CONTRADICTORY.  THEY WANT
ENERGETIC, OMNIPROVIDENT GOVERNMENT, BUT THEY WANT IT UNDER CONTROL.
CONVINCED THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS BECOME AUTONOMOUS, THEY HAVE TRIED
TO CONTROL IT BY TAX LIMITS (1978'S PROPOSITION 13), AND NOW BY TERM
LIMITS, AND ALMOST ALWAYS BY VOTING FOR DIVIDED GOVERNMENT.  LAST
TUESDAY THE NATION, TOO, AGAIN SAID CLEARLY THAT IT IS COMFORTABLE
WITH DIVIDED GOVERNMENT.  That means permanent partisan conflict
between two branches of government claiming contradictory mandates.
GOVERNMENT RARELY WORKS WELL THIS WAY, BUT TODAY, WHEN REPRESENTATIVE
GOVERNMENT IS GRIDLOCKED, IT IS, IN ONE SENSE, SUCCEEDING:  IT IS
FAITHFULLY REPRESENTING THE CONTRADICTION IN THE ELECTORATE'S MIND.
