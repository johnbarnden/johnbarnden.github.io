Subheader:  BOTH PARTIES DECLARED VICTORY- AND THEN PORED OVER THE
	ELECTION RESULTS TO SEE WHAT WENT WRONG 
By:  Eloise Salholz with Eleanor Clift, Ann McDaniel and Thomas M.
	DeFrank in Washington, Lucille Beachy in New York, Andrew Murr
	in Los Angeles, Howard Manly in Atlanta and bureau reports

1st column	2nd paragraph
IN TRUTH, THE RESULTS WERE SO MIED THAT BOTH PARTIES HAD REASON TO
WORRY.  Despite predictions of an insurgency at the polls, voters
returned 96 percent of congressional incumbents seeking re-election.
But they gave a number of key figures unexpectedly slim margins:
popular two-term Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey nearly lost to an
unknown challenger, and Minority Whip Newt Gingrich almost found
himself on a midnight train to Georgie- without a job.  The Democrats
cemented their hold over Congress with a probable gain of eight House
seats- not enough to override a presidential veto but more than enough
to make the White House squirm- and solidified their place in the sun,
taking the Florida and Texas statehouses.  But the GOP won the big
one- California- and made serious inroads throughout the rust belt.
Overall, the Democrats will be well situated to expand their
congressional majorities when state legislatures begin redistricting
next year.

3rd paragraph to top of 2nd column
NO ONE FELT GREATER PRESSURE TO DRAW LESSONS FROM THE RESULTS THAN
BUSH, SINCE THE VOTE WAS CLEARLY A REFERENDUM ON HIM, TOO.  Two days
after the elections, he invited several of his closest outside
advisers to an East Wing lunch.  His first question:  "Where can I
improve?"  (ANYONE WHO THOUGHT THE ANSWER WAS TO FIRE JOHN SUNUNU HELD
HIS TONGUE SINCE THE CHIEF OF STAFF WAS ALSO PRESENT.)  Bush also
announced a new no-tax pledge, saying that next time Democrats would
have to raise income tax rates "over my dead veto."  Congressmen, too,
will probably take last week's close calls as a mandate for cowardice:
running scared, they are less likely than ever to step out in front of
difficult issues, or to reform a process that protects their seats.
But there are risks in playing safe.  "AMERICANS ARE VERY ANGRY AND
CYNICAL ABOUT THE SYSTEM," SAYS GOP POLLSTER RICHARD WIRTHLIN.  "They
think government is simply not governing."

pg. 35		2nd column	2nd paragraph
PHONE HOME:  Like nagging moms, voters in several states nudged their
wayward sons to visit more often and stop being such big shots.  New
York Gov. Mario Cuomo, who won a less than convincing victory against
a field of nobodies, may have some fence mending ahead of him.  ""We
didn't get that exulant shout that we wanted to hear from the people,"
he admitted afterward.  Bradley, who ran celebritylike ads and
wouldn't deign to discuss taxes, fervently promised the people to
serve out his hardwon third term.  AND CONSERVATIVE GOP FIREBRAND NEWT
GINGRICH, WHO OBVIOUSLY FORGOT THOMAS P. (TIP) O'NEILL'S AXIOM THAT
"ALL POLITICS ARE LOCAL," ALSO FOUND THE NATIVES RESTLESS.  "People
here want a nice Georgia congressman who will care about their sewer,"
says Kate Head, campaign manager for challenger David Worley, who has
demanded a recount.  By contrast, Democrats Lawton Chiles, who won
Florida's gubernatorial race, and Paul Wellstone, Minnesota's new
senator, ran highly effective grass-roots campaigns.

bottom of pg. 36	2nd column	1st paragraph
All the same, Cuomo remains the darling of the pundit class.  The
latest guess is that the %million left over from his gubernatorial war
chest is evidence that he's running.  THIS, OF COURSE, ASSUMES ANOTHER
BIT OF CONVENTIONAL THINKING- THAT BIG MONEY IS ESSENTIAL.  In 1990,
anyway, that wasn't always the case.  Bradley's opponent, Christine
Whitman, was outspent 12 to 1.  Ann Richards in Texas and Lawton
Chiles in Florida lost the fund-raising race but won anyway.  Beyond a
certain level necessary for maintaining a presence on the air, money
is mostly a way for reporters and other insiders to keep score.

3rd column	1st paragraph
LONG SHOTS:  If so, the politicians are fighting the last war.  It's
always senseless to sell long shots short, but besides Nebrska Gov.
Bob Kerrey, that's exactly what's happening.  Names like Florida Sen.
Bob Graham and Colorado Sen. Tim Wirth haven't even been floated, and
it's not so early anymore.  OF COURSE WITH SO MUCH OF THE PENT-UP
DEMAND FOR REFORM THWARTED THIS YEAR, 1992 COULD BE THE YEAR WHEN A
REAL OUTSIDER STORMS UP THE BARRICADES.  Who?  Think Colin Powell (who
won't reveal his party ID), Ralph Nader, Ted Turner, ex-drug-czar
William Bennettt (yes, a Democrat).  If they're unbearable, think some
more.

Title:  The Bush Blueprint Bombs
Subheader:  THINGS AREN'T GOING WELL FOR THE GOP- AND THEY'RE ABOUT TO
	GET WORSE
By:  Kevin Phillips

2nd column	2nd paragraph to top of 3rd column
Takeover prospets in the Senate are not much better.  A year ago
Republicans took their blueprint seriously enough to enlist five
popular Republican representatives to tackle "vulnerable" Democratice
senators in 1990.  All five were sacrificed in vain; not a single
Democrative Senate incumbent fell.  The sole candidate to beat an
incumbent, Minnesota's Wellstone, campaigned for taxing the wealthy-
and had been arrested several years ago at a bank sit-in protesting
farm foreclosures.  NOBODY HAD THOUGHT HE HAD A CHANCE.

3rd column	1st paragraph
FEW BIG-NAME DEMOCRATS, IN FACT, HAD WANTED TO MAKE 1990 SENATE RACES
IN WHAT SUPPOSED TO BE A STRONG ECONOMY AND A GOOD GOP YEAR.
Potentially strong contenders in Virginia, Indiana, Idaho, and Oregon
sat out races several could have won.  BUT EVEN SO, BY PICKING UP ON
ONE SEAT, THE DEMOCRATS EFFECTIVELY BLOCKED ANY REPUBLICAN HOPES FOR
1992, WHEN THEY'D NEED SEVEN SEATS FOR A MAJORITY.

pg.41		1st column	1st paragraph
IF THIS ALONE WEREN'T ENOUGH TO FRIGHTEN BUSH'S RE-ELECTION
STRATEGISTS, THERE'S ALSO GROWING SPECULATION THAT FINANCIAL PRESSURE
(RANGING FROM TUMBLING REAL-ESTATE VALUES TO DANGEROUS CORPORATE-DEBT
LOADS AND SPREADING BANK INSOLVENCIES) COULD MAKE THE 1991 DOWNTURN
FEED ON ITSELF, DEEPENDING INTO SEVERE RECESSION.  DEMOCRATS HAVE
ALREADY FOUND THAT ATTACKING BUSH AND THE REPUBLICANS FOR FAVORING THE
RICH IS A POTENT POLITICAL WEAPON.  But it has also been my thesis
that the 1980s, like the Roaring Twenties and the late-19th-century
Gilded Age, represented a once-a-generation bubble of debt and
speculation with the unnerving potential too implode and trigger a
populist reaction.  Some of that implosion-and-populist-reaction is
underway.  Will it intensify?  That is an all-important question, to
be answered over the next year or so.

2nd paragraph
MOREOVER, THE REPUBLICANS HAVE REASON TO WORRY THAT PRESIDENT BUSH
WILL HAVE TO CONFRONT ACCELERATING DOMESTIC AND INTERNATINAL PROBLEMS
AT A TIME WHEN HE HAS DEPLETED PRESTIGE AND LITTLE CONGRESSIONAL CLOUT
(LIKE THAT WHICH HOBBLED JIMMY CARTER IN 1979-80).  Since Election
Day, Republicans and Democrats in Congress, already self-centered and
unrly, have also become scared and fearful- scared by 1990s voter
surliness, fearful that grass-roots retribution could escalate in 1992
when many representatives will be running in partly new and unfamiliar
(and potentiall unfriendly) districts.  Anarchy is too strong a term,
but legislators' parochialism and self-entrenchment are sure to
deepen.  Cooperating with the White House is not likely to be a
heartfelt priority.

3rd column	1st paragraph		middle
It's the old schism- Main Street versus Wall Street, Peoria versus
Palm Beach.  Other cleavages are culgural, with largely Jewish
"neoconservatives" squaring off against fundamentalist-tinged
Christian "paleo-conservatives."  And international questions have
widened two more splits:  one between economic nationalists and free
traders and another between neo-isolationists and global
interventionists.  IF, AS MANY NOW EXPECT, THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION
MOVES TO ATTACK IRAQ, ANY NUMBER OF POLITICAL SCENARIOS COULD DEVELOP.
The American public will probably support a war- at first.  but if the
economy continues to worsen, producing what could be the 20th
century's first wartime recession even as body bags start coing home
to Dover Air Force Base, the politics could sour, too.

3rd column	2nd paragraph
All in all, George Bush could well be the last president of the
Republican White House cycle that began 22 years ago with Richard
Nixon.  And this raises a caution.  Final presidents of party cycles
are especially prone to be remembered for failure- Herbert Hoover for
the Great Crash, Lyndon Johnson for Vietnam and urban riots.  SO WHILE
ONE CONSERVATIVE CRITIC RECENTLY SUGGESTED THAT BUSH COULD BE GERALD
FORD AND JIMMY CARTER ROLLED INTO ONE, THERE'S AN EVEN MORE DISTRUBING
ANALOGY TO CONTEMPLATE- THE CHANCE THAT HE COULD COMBINE HERBERT
HOOVER'S ECONOMICS AND LYNDON JOHNSON'S MILITARY MISJUDGMENT.  It's no
more than a one-in-10 prospect, but perhaps even noting it can help
keep it from becoming a fact.

Title:  Cities on the Brink
Subheader:  PHILADELPHIA IS NOT THE ONLY ONE GOING BROKE
By:  Bill Turque with Lucille Beachy in New York, Tom Ferrick in
	Philadelphia and Mark Miller in Washington

1st column	1st paragraph
With no local economic turnaround expected before mid-1992, Mayor
David Dinkins faces an agonizing round of belt tightening.  It won't
be easy.  The city has added 50,000 employees to the payroll since
1983.  Many were added to meet pressing needs in the city's schools,
jails and social-service agencies; BUT FEW EXPERTS BELIEVE THE CITY IS
FUNCTIONALLY EFFICIENTLY- OR LOGICALLY.  In five days last month,
Dinkins awarded city teachers a 5.5 percent raise, announced plans to
hire 6,000 new cops- and then said 15,000 layoffs might be needed.
Dinkins's flip-flops "give the impression no one's at the whell," says
James Hughes, a professor of urban planning at Rutgers University.

2nd paragraph
PINK-SLIP-PROOF:  In Washington, which faces a $200 million budget
deficit, the question is whether the wheel has been stolen.  Last
month the city council, concerned that outgoing Mayor Marion Barry was
using his final weeks in office to grant favors to cronies, required
that he submit all contracts over $1 million for approval.  Barry
responded by vetoing the measure.  MAYOR-ELECT SHARON PRATT DIXON, WHO
PROMISED TO FIRE 2,000 BUREAUCRATS, LEARNED THAT THE TASK WILL BE MORE
DIFFICULT THAN SHE ASSUMED.  More than half of Barry's top political
appointees may be protected by the civil-service system, making them
virtually pink-slip-proof.

Title:  Busting the Prince of Love
Subheader:  A MIAMI CULT LEADER IS CHARGED WITH MURDER
By:  Charles Leerhsen with Peter Katel in Miami

2nd column	1st paragraph
Anyone who calls himself Yahweh should be viewed with skepticism.
Hulon Mitchell Jr. calls himself Yahweh Ben Yahweh ("God the son of
God").  He wears flowing robes, claims to be the leader of a lost
black tribe of Israel and makes speeches in which he says his
followers, no Jews, are the original Semites.  The 55-year-old leader
would be as dismissible as any other full-bearded, self-proclaimed
savior if not for one thing:  he can deliver as many as 12,000 votes
to politicians in and around Miami, where his cult, the Nation of
Yahweh, prospers.  Those are the kinds of numbers that turn skepticism
to support, and so last month Miami Mayor Xavier Suarez proclaimed
Yahweh Ben Yahweh Day.  "They do inculcate a certain lwefulness and
discipline in their members, which is admirable," the mayor once said.
According to a federal grand jury, though, the cult's methods are
anything but admirable.  THIS YAHWEH DOESN'T BELIEVE IN AN EYE FOR AN
EYE:  THE INDICTMENT SAYS FOLLOWERS SOMETIMES BROUGHT HIM A VICTIM'S
EAR.

3rd column	2nd paragraph
Even the man who calls himself the "prince of peace" doesn't deny
people were killed by some in the movement.  "I BELIEVE THERE IS SOME
VALIDITY TO THE CHARGES," HIS LAWYER, ELLIS RUBIN, TOLD NEWSWEEK.
"But there is no connection between the charges and Yahweh Ben Yahweh.
It's like three Catholics get together and plan a robbery or a murder.
And the Feds indict the pope."  Except that it's hard to imagine Rome
remaining silent if John Paul II went to jail.  "I wouldn't try to
cross them," was all one Liberty City resident would say about the
Yahwehs last week.

Title:  Solidarity No More
Subheader:  POLAND'S PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION PITS TWO OLD FRIENDS IN A
	BITTER BATTLE
By:  Andrew Nagorski in Warsaw

1st column	2nd paragraph
These days the people of Poland are being inundated in the rhetoric of
democracy.  And this time it's for real.  The country's Nov. 25
presidential election is the first in postcommunist Eastern Europe to
pit one noncommunist against another.  No more one-sided contests
between once outlawed political parties and the old-time regimes.  No
more easy choices between the heroes of the revolution and their
onetime jailers.  This is a power struggle between leaders who both
fought on the same side of the barricades- but who now differ greatly
over the direction Poland should follow.  Some Poles are finding the
transition hard to accept.  "FOR THE FIRST TIME," SAYS SOCIOLOGIST
TADEUSZ SZAWIEL, "THEY WILL HAVE TO BE AGAINST SOMEONE WITH WHOM THEY
ARE EMOTIONALLY TIED."

3rd paragraph to top of 2nd column
WALESA PLAYS MOST EASILY ON THOSE TIES.  HE TELLS HIS AUDIENCES THAT
HE WANTS TO BE PRESIDENT ONLY TO ACCELERATE POLAND'S TRANSITION TO
DEMOCRACY AND A DECENT STANDARD OF LIVING.  "The richer you are, the
richer Poland will be," he says.  He is a virtuoso campaigner.  His
standard pitch begins with an appeal "not to let yourselves be
directed by emotions, even toward me."  but he soon assures his
audience, "I am one of you," and points out his rural origins and
working-class pedigree.  The he may float one of his economic-reform
proposals- a scheme to offer every Pole more than $10,000 to set up a
new business.  Walesa calls it an interest-free, 20-year loan.

3rd column	1st paragraph
ALTHOUGH WALESA NO LONGER BOASTS HE WILL WIN 80 PERCENT OF THE VOTE,
HE RADIATES CONFIDENCE THAT HE WILL EXCEED THE 50 PERCENT REQUIRED FOR
VICTORY IN THE FIRST ROUND DESPITE THE PRESENCE OF FOUR MNOR
CANDIDATES.  Mazowiecki's chances are "minimal," he told NEWSWEEK, and
the best thing for Poland would be his withdrawal from the race; under
those condition, Walesa says, Mazowiecki could stay on as prime
minister.  However, Mazowiecki told NEWSWEEK he had made "a choice
connected with a certain vision of democracy and the presidency,"
leaving no doubt that he is in the race to the end.

3rd column	quote- center page
WHAT I FEAR IS A CERTAIN CHAOS AND WASTE OF WHAT HAS BEEN ACHIEVED
OVER THE PAST YEAR.
-Tadeusz Mazowiecki

pg. 48		1st column	1st paragraph
Historian Bronislaw Geremek, who supported Mazowiecki, stepped down
last week as the leader of the Solidarity bloc in Parliament.  In his
place the legislators chose a former steelworker who backs Walesa.
"One Solidarity elite has been at the top for 10 years," says Walesa
adviser Zdzislaw Najder.  "It's time for a change in elites."  The
change mirrors a larger class conflict.   WALESA LEADS AMONG WORKERS,
OLDER PEOPLE ON PENNSIONS AND THOSE WHO FEEL THEY HAVE SACRIFICED MOST
UNDER THE "SHOCK THERAPY" ECONOMIC POLICIES INTRODUCED EARLY THIS
YEAR.  Support for the highly cultured Mazowiecki is strongest among
urban intellectuals; the more educated a voter, the more likely he is
to support ROAD.

3rd paragraph
TO HIS MOST FERVENT OPPONENETS, WALESA WOULD BE DANGERSOU EITHER IN
VICTORY OR IN DEFEAT.  IF HE LOSES, THEY FEAR, HE COULD DESTABILIZE
THE COUNTRY BY INSTIGATING NEW POPULAR PROTESTS.  WALESA DENIES ANY
SUCH INTENTION BUT ARGUES THAT HE ALONE COMMANDS ENOUGH AUTHORITY TO
LEAD POLAND THROUGH THE NEXT STAGE OF DIFFICULT REFORMS.  If he wins?
He has hinted that he may keep some of Mazowiecki's team, particularly
Finance Minister Balcerowicz, to demonstrate that he is continuing
rather than breaking with the reforms already in place.  He remains a
formidable figure, grudgingly respected even by some of those who now
oppose him.  "At difficult moments, Walesa has always come to his
senses and been able to choose the best solution," says Sen. Andrzej
Celinski, a Mazowiecki supporter.  But Mazowiecki has already proven
that he can make the kind of unpopular decisions required by the
country's desperate circumstances.  No one ever said that democracy
was easy, and Poland is learning that lesson this month.

Title:  The High Price of Hatred
Subheader:  KAHANE'S MURDER UNLEASHES A WAVE OF RETRIBUTION
By:  Tom Masland with Theodore Stranger in Jerusalem

2nd column	2nd paragraph
His followers claimed that Kahane, 58, was the victim of an
orchestrated Arab hit.  But New York City police said the accused
killer apparently acted alone.  POLICE GAVE THIS ACCOUNT:  EL SAYYID
A. NOSAIR, 34, WAS FRUSTRATED THAT IN SPITE OF HIS ENGINEERING
TRAINING IN EGYPT, THE BEST JOB HE COULD FIND HERE WAS AS A
MAINTENANCE WORKER FOR THE CITY; A FAMILY MEMBER SAID HE WAS TAKING
THE ANTIDEPRESSION DRUG PROZAC.  A devout Muslim who emigrated to the
United States in 1981, Nosair read a newspaper ad for the speaking
engagement.  He went to the hotel and shot Kahane in the neck at close
range as he spoke to a Zionist group about his plan to expel all Arabs
from Israel.  Nosair fled, but was shot and wounded by a postal police
officer about a block away.  Nosair denied he killed Kahane.

3rd paragraph to top of 3rd column
In life, Kahane showled little interest in making friends.  Born
Martin Kahane in Brooklyn, he styled himself a militant Zionist in the
mold of Menachem Begin but informed on leftists for the FBI, swindled
investors and flagrantly broke his marriage vows.  YET MANY WEALTHY
AMERICAN JEWS QUIETLY SUBSIDIZED HIS PARAMILITARY JEWISH DEFENSE
LEAGUE; AS KAHANE TOLD THEM, "I SAY WHAT YOU THINK."

3rd column	2nd paragraph
VIOLENT LEGACY:  Though stymied as a politician, Kahane helped lead
Israel's decade-old shift to the right.  He made the once
unmentionable part of the political mainstream.  THIRTY PERCENT OF ALL
ISRAELIS NOW WANT TO EXPEL ARABS OR ANNEX THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
OUTRIGHT, A POLL PUBLISHED FRIDAY SAID.  Several Knesset parties
openly espouse some kind of "transfer" of Arabs to Jordan, Egypt and
other neighboring countries.  Kahane's organization is unlikely to
survive him.  But his violent legacy will.

Title:  `Pouring Money Down a Bad Hole'
Subheader:  THE PRESSURE BUILDS TO END U.S. AID TO EL SALVADOR
By:  Douglas Waller in Washington and Tim Padgett in San Salvador

1st column	1st paragraph
Marxist-led guerrillas are again filtering down from the mountains
toward the outskirts of El Salvardor's capital city.  But for the
first time in 10 years the rightist-dominated government will have to
face the rebels with the declining support from the United States.
Last week President Bush grudgingly signed a 50 percent cut in
military aid for El Salvador voted by Congress.  THE SHIFT IN POLICY
REFLECTS A GROWING SENSE IN WASHINGTON THAT, WITH THE COLD WAR OVER,
THE UNITED STATES HAS LITTLE TAKE IN THE CONFLICT- AND LITTLE TO SHOW
FOR THE $4 BILLION IT HAS ALREADY SPENT ON EL SALVADOR.

Title:  India:  Gandhi Pulls the Strings, Again

1st column	1st paragraph
Being prime minister of India is one of the most thankless jobs in the
world- a bit like being mayor of New York City.  But for more than 20
years, veteran Indian politician Chandra Shekhar has coveted it.  LAST
WEEK HE GOT HIS WISH- INHERITING THE VAST NATION'S WORST CRISIS SINCE
INDEPENDENCE.  Shekhar, 63, faces a rising tide of Hindu
fundamentalism, separatist violence, caste conflict and skyrocketing
food prices.  Just what he plans to do about them he's never really
said.  

3rd column	middle
The Indian Express called the new government a "political freak" with
a "miniscule head in front" and Congress's "enormous rump" leading
from behind.  BUT MOST INDIAN POLITICAL ANALYSTS BELIEVE THAT THE
ARRANGEMENT WILL LAST ONLY UNTIL GANDHI AND CONGRESS HAVE CRANKED UP
THEIR POLITICAL MACHINE FOR A NEW ELECTION- AND BID FAREWELL TO
SHEKHAR.

Subheader:  AS CORPORATE TIES TO ENVIRONMENTALISTS GROW, SO DO STRAIN
	AND SKEPTICISM
By:  John Schwartz with Karen Springen in Chicago and Mary Hager in
	Washington

2nd column	2nd paragraph to top of 3rd column
Even the efforts to simplify things have gotten complicated.  A
product seal of approval like Germany's Blue Angel should help, but
there is a crowd of competing seal- 10 at last count (chart).  While
stores like Wal-Mart use in-house green labels, environmentalists are
looking toward three seals:  Green Cross, which verifies specific
product claims, and two soon-to-be-introduced labels, Good
Earthkeeping (from Good Housekeeping) and Green Seal.  EARTH DAY
CHAIRPERSON DENIS HAYES IS HOPING HIS GREEN SEAL WILL SET CRITERIA FOR
"ENVIRONMENTALLY WISE" PRODUCTS "ANALYZED CRADLE TO GRAVE."

3rd column	1st paragraph
JITTERY VOTERS:  Sound confusing?  It is, even for the pros.  Green is
a moving target, says Katherine Tiddens, whose soon-to-open Terra
Verde in Manhattan will offer goods from paper to low-toxicity
building materials.  Businesses like Tiddens's- such as the Boston
area's Green Planet and Houston's Earthies- are making money by
helping consumers find their way.  So do catalogs like Seventh
Generation and consumer guides like Shopping for a Better World,
produced by the New York-based Council on Economic Priorities.  AND
CONSUMERS NEED HELP:  A NEW SURVEY BY THE COUNCIL ON PLASTICS AND
PACKAGING IN THE ENVIRONMENT SHOWS THAT FEWER THAN A QUARTER EVEN KNOW
WHAT "ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY" MEANS.

2nd paragraph
Despite the boom, environmentalists were shaken by the loss of green
initiatives.  Why did they lose so big?  "the question is, will the
public spend whatever it takes?"  Says Barry Mannis, vice president
for environmental services at Morgan Stanley.  "For the moment, the
answer is no."  Some say recession jitters made voters reject measures
tht might have put a drag on the economy.  Others blame high
anti-green campaign spending by the business community- or, as in
California, even animosity toward one of the measure's sponsors, state
assemblyman Tom Hayden.  But perhaps the answer is more personal.
AMERICANS LIKE TO CHOOSE SAFER PRODUCTS, BUT RESENT HAVING CHOICES
TAKEN AWAY BY THE GOVERNMENT- AND SOMETIMES YOU WANT TO EAT A BURGER,
HOWEVER IT'S WRAPPED.  green thinking is certainly here to stay, but
the election upsets can only add pressure to the delicate relationship
between environmentalists and the private sector.
