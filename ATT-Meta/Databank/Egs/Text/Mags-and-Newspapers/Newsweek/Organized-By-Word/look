Title:  Moscow's Two-Edged Plowshare
Subheader:  THE SOVIET UNION GAINS A FOOTHOLD IN THE GULF
By:  Russel Watson with Margaret Garrard Warner and Fred Coleman in
	Moscow
column 3	1st paragraph
ARABIST OUTLOOK:  An academic specialist and former journalist in the
Middle East, Primakov, 61, is an influential member of Gorbachev's
Presidential Council.  As an Arabist, he represents a bureaucratic
mind-set at odds with that of Shevardnadze, for whom the U.S.-Soviet
relationship is of paramount importance.  "Primakov ~LOOKS~ at Saddam,
and he sees a longstanding soviet relationship that he wants to
preserve if he possibly can," says Andrei Kortunov, an analyst at
Moscow's Institute for the U.S.A. and CANADA.  By allowing Primakov to
play a conspicuous role in the crisis, Gorbachev keeps his Arab
options open for as long as he can.
