2nd paragraph to bottom of pg. 30
Somewhere south of Kuwait, the Third Battalion of the 11th Marines is
dug into desert trenches, its 155-mm howitzers ready to deliver
supporting fire for a tank assault or amphibious invasion.  At sunup,
Marines crowd around the tailgate of a truck for mail call.  In the
heat and dust of the outpost, letters become tattered and stained.
Capt. Jerry Sneed carries in his pocket a creased sheet from his son.
It has a drawing of the Marine Corps War Memorial- the flag raising on
Iwo Jima- and the words "To Dad.  You make me proud Dad.  Jeremy."
Off to the side, Pfc. John Duggan ~HOPES~ for word from his fiancee
Kathryn Redman.  They were engaged three days before he was sent to
Saudi Arabia.  "I'm in love, I can't ~THINK~ about anything else," he
says.  "I ~FEEL TOTALLY EMPTY~.  I live in a hole in the ground and the
only thing that helps me to pass the time is her letters," he syas.
He writes her constantly.  One time he pulled some hair off his chest
and sent it to her.  She sent him back a strand of her hair.  Then he
sent her those desert weeds and an impassioned audiotape.  "It was
like he was right here," she says.  "At the end of the tape I was
hugging the speaker next to me."

Title:  Letters in the Sand
pg. 32		1st column	1st paragraph
The mail is a bridge, however rickety, between duty and love.  Out on
the line, Marine Lance Cpl. Frank Gudmundson, 22, a fire team leader
whoo will see sharp fighting if war breaks out, logs his letters and
thoughts in a journal.  He has entitled his little notebook "Total
(1990) Recall."  "My mind and my heart belong at home with my wife,
but my ass belongs to the Marine Corps," he writes in one passage.
The next sentence is "I will stand by patiently for mail call."  When
his mother sent a photo of him and his brothers as little kids, he
wrote in his diary, "It seems like yesterday we were out playing army
with our plastic machine guns, building bunkers out of hay bales and
counting to fifty when we had gotten shot.  Now it's the real thing
today.  And I don't ~THINK~ counting to fifty will bring us back alive."

Title:  `Somebody in Saudi Arabia Loves Me'
Subheader:  THE FAMILIES LEFT BEHIND STRUGGLE TO FILL THE VOID
By:  Barbara Kantrowitz
pg. 33
3rd column	3rd paragraph
UNDER STRESS:  And always, there is the fear of hearing the worst
possible news.  The Army has procedures for notifying next of kin
(NOK, military parlance).  but under stress, it's easy to panic.  Last
week, one Fort Campbell wife, visiting relatives in Illinois, received
what she ~THOUGHT~ was official word that her husband had been shot and
was on his way to Walter Reed Army Hospital in Washington, D.C.  She
immediately flew to Washington, but no one at the hospital had any
information about her husband.  Finally, Army officials in Kentucky
checked with the troops in Saudi Arabia.  Her husband was fine; the
call had been a sick joke by an unknown prankster.

Title:  Looking for Lessons
Subheader:  BOTH PARTIES DECLARED VICTORY- AND THEN PORED OVER THE
	ELECTION RESULTS TO SEE WHAT WENT WRONG 
pg. 34
3rd paragraph to top of 2nd column
No one ~FELT~ greater pressure to draw lessons from the results than
Bush, since the vote was clearly a referendum on him, too.  Two days
after the elections, he invited several of his closest outside
advisers to an East Wing lunch.  His first question:  "Where can I
improve?"  (Anyone who ~THOUGHT~ the answer was to fire John Sununu held
his tongue since the chief of staff was also present.)  Bush also
announced a new no-tax pledge, saying that next time Democrats would
have to raise income tax rates "over my dead veto."  Congressmen, too,
will probably take last week's close calls as a mandate for cowardice:
running scared, they are less likely than ever to step out in front of
difficult issues, or to reform a process that protects their seats.
But there are risks in playing safe.  "AMERICANS ARE VERY ANGRY AND
CYNICAL ABOUT THE SYSTEM," SAYS GOP POLLSTER RICHARD WIRTHLIN.  "They
~THINK~ government is simply not governing."
