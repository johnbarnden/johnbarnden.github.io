Subheader:  THE SOVIET UNION GAINS A FOOTHOLD IN THE GULF
3rd column	1st paragraph
Some troops flew, sitting on equipment crammed into transports, others
went by sea, packed like sardines.  NO MATTER HOW THEY GOT THERE, THEY
KNEW THE SANDPILE WAS WAITING THERE FOR THEM.  Cpl. Edward Gregoire,
19, a Marine who came from Hawaii, wrote to his parents saying, "Hey
the Persian Gulf sounds nasty, but it's beautiful, too.  Crystal clear
water.  Dolphins following the boat."  Returning from a flight, Gary
Porterfield, 28, an Air Force pilot wrote: "It's nothing but sand.
One big beach.  I CAN'T BELIEVE PEOPLE ACTUALLY LIVE HERE."  The place
had a way of bringing out the Omar Khayyam in the most prosaic grunt.
"You should see the night," Army Sp/4 Larry Campbell wrote his wife,
Barbar.  "The sky comes alive with a billion stars and a moon that
seems s bright as a spotlight.  It's like you can see the whole
galaxy."

Others felt the same way.  Herbert Plummer, 21, a paratrooper, wrote
his mother to say that some nights he couldn't sleep "because of my
fear of this place."  HE DIDN'T KNOW WHY, BUT "BEEING IN THIS COUNTRY
MAKES ME SO JUMPY I CAN ALMOST FEEL AS IF SOMEONE IS WATCHING ME.  No
lie!"  At other outposts, dead camels beyond the defense perimeters
made the desert stink.  A fire incinerated one unit's mailroom.
Nerves tautened.  Even friends grew edgy.  Then, each evening just
after dark, Baghdad Betty, Saddam Hussein's answer to Tokyo Rose, got
on the radio to work on them.  "She tells us we're going to die and
Iraqi worms are going to eat us," Army Sgt. Eric Petersen reported to
his wife, Maryann.  "Pretty awful, huh?"

Title:  In Peril on the Sea
Tyrone M. Brooks, 19, of Detroit, Mich., died Oct. 30 in a boiler
accident aboard the USS Iwo Jima.  From a letter to his fiancee,
Juanita Smith:
2nd paragraph
I am just fine.  I miss you and the baby a lot.  I ~WISH~ I could be
there to hold both you and her or him.  Did I tell you we have gone
halfway around the world?  I talked to my division officer the other
day, and he said if we are back before you have the baby he will make
sure that I am home for the birth of our child.  You ~KNOW~ how he ~KNOWS~
I am having a child is that he saw you when you came aboard the ship.
Have you talked to my mother since the last time you wrote?  If not,
you better call her so she can know how her daughter-in-law and
grandbaby are doing.  If I am not home when you go into labor, call so
my brother can come to the hospital.  Have you picked out a baby bed
yet?  Are you going to have a baby shower so all your friends can buy
my baby all those nice gifts?  If you need the money to have one, just
tell me how much and when to send it.  Well, I have to go now but
~REMEMBER~ I love you and the baby.  Write me back as soon as you get
this letter.  Let's see if we can keep a steady flow of mail to each
other.  That's all.  P.S. I will buy the baby what you pick out when I
get home.

Title:  `Somebody in Saudi Arabia Loves Me'
Subheader:  THE FAMILIES LEFT BEHIND STRUGGLE TO FILL THE VOID
By:  Barbara Kantrowitz
3rd paragraph to top of page 33
A few children waved goodbye to both parents.  Col. Ted Purdom left on
Sept. 24.  Amonth later, his wife, Lt. Col. Jean Purdom, shipped out.
Jean's mother Frances McKenna, came from Massachusetts to look after
grandsons Matthew, 11, and T.J., 9.  They save their parent's letters.
In one, dated Oct. 24, Ted Purdom wrote:  "Matt, I think of you each
day and I wear your acolyte cross all the time.  I JUST LOVE IT AND
KNOW IT PROTECTS ME."  ALTHOUGH THE ARMY HAS PUT NO TIME LIMITS ON
TOURS OF DUTY, T.J. BELIEVES HIS PARENTS WILL BE AWAY FOR SIX MONTHS:
"FIVE MORE MONTHS FOR MY MOM AND FOUR MORE MONTHS FOR MY DAD."  When
they return, "Me and Dad are going to go hunting and fishing.  My mom,
I'm going to save up money to buy her something.  Maybe a hair dryer."
