Title:  Moscow's Two-Edged Plowshare, pg. 25
Subheader:  THE SOVIET UNION GAINS A FOOTHOLD IN THE GULF
1st column	1st paragraph
There aren't many statesmen who have discussed the Persian Gulf Crisis
in depth with both George Bush and Saddam Hussein.  One who has,
Soviet envoy Yevgeny Primakov, has become a professional optimist.  "I
AM CONFIDENT THAT A PEACEFUL SOLUTION IS POSSIBLE," HE SAID LAST WEEK
DURING A RECEPTION IN THE KREMLIN.  SOVIET SOURCES CONCEDE THAT AFTER
TWO SESSIONS WITH THE UBIQUITOUS PRIMAKOV LAST MONTH, SADDAM SHOWS NO
SIGN OF ACTUAL MOVEMENT TOWARD A COMPROMISE.  Even so, the role of
peacemaker has paid off handsomely for Primakov and for the Kremlin.
