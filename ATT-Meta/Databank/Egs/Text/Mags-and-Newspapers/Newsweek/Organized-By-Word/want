Title:  Moscow's Two-Edged Plowshare
Subheader:  THE SOVIET UNION GAINS A FOOTHOLD IN THE GULF
By:  Russel Watson with Margaret Garrard Warner and Fred Coleman in
	Moscow
2nd paragraph to top of 3rd column

American officials and some Soviet analysts believe Gorbachev has
conflicting objectives.  He ~WANTS~ a partnership with Washington, but
he also wants to make sure that Moscow comes out on the right side of
whatever happens in the gulf.  Since the Crisis began, the Kremlin has
kept up relations with Baghdad, deciding to leave  thousands of
oilfield workers and at least 133 military specialists in Iraq until
their work contracts were completed.  Moscow also has agressively
courted other countries that can help it, economically or politically,
improving its relations with Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Israel.

Title:  To Sir, With Love
1st column	2nd paragraph
Right now we are living near an oasis.  There is a small deserted
village here and it's over 300 years old.  Camels, wild dogs and goats
come t drink water from the well and eat the dates that fall from the
trees.  Even though our soldiers and pilots, men and women, train very
hard to go to war, all of us here don't ~WANT~ that to happen.  War is
not what you see at the movies; it's ugly and painful.  We're here to
protect other people [and] because this part of the world is very
important to our economy and businesses.  Hopefully, our actions will
make a difference.

Title:  Letters in the Sand

pg. 30
3rd column	1st paragraph
Mail alone cannot neutralize the Vietnam syndrome, but it helps.
Marine Staff Sgt. William Fitgerald, 30, was too young for Vietnam.
When he joined the corps 11 years ago, he heard Viet vets telling
horror stories all the time.  "They'd get letters from home, sure," he
says.  "But the media, the war protesters, even some of the
politicians were telling them they were doing the wrong thing, they
were murderers, they were on their own."  Now he gets letters from a
nun in Philadelphia who had eight brothers in World War II.  "She told
me she was ~PROUD~ of what we were doing, and cared for us and- with a
name like Fitzgerald, to say a rosary if I was Catholic."  He heard his
son say "Papa" for the first time when his wife, Carole, sent him an
audiotape.  Determined that the American soldier won't be forgotten
this time, she has distributed 2,000 aluminum bracelets marked "1990-
"Til our Fighting Forces Return."  She has also written to President
Bush, saying, "We ~WANT~ people to ~REMEMBER~ when they start complaining
about the price of gas to ~THINK~ of the people who are putting their
lives on the line."

Title:  `Somebody in Saudi Arabia Loves Me'
Subheader:  THE FAMILIES LEFT BEHIND STRUGGLE TO FILL THE VOID
By:  Barbara Kantrowitz
top of pg. 33		1st column	1st paragraph
Years ago the Army didn't ~WORRY~ too much about the problems of spouses
and children on the home front.  There's an old saying:  if the Army
~WANTED~ you to have a wife, it would have issued you one.  That
attitude is a luxury the all-volunteer Army can no longer afford.
Attracting career soldiers means provodomg for their families as well.
At Fort Campbell, there are seven schools for 4,000 students from the
elementary grades through high school, a childcare center, financial
and emotional counseling services- even a woodworking class to teach
wives how to make home repairs while their husbands are away.
