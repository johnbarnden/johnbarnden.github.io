bottom of pg. 30	2nd column	1st paragraph
About 85 percent of Major Vaughn's letters and packages are addressed
to individuals.  He gives those marked "To any service personnel" to
people who get nothing from home.  It is not uncommon to find a
battle-hardened Viet vet like Massengill carrying on earnest
correspondence with 7- and 8-year-old kids and dusty grunts laughing
over lines from tiny pen pals like "If you guys can't end it, then my
Dad might have to come."  Kids not much younger than Pfc. Hosi
Johnson, 19, of the 101st Airborne, who was in high school in Chicago
only a year ago write to ask if he feels scared.  He tells them, "Yes,
It's always at the ~BACK OF MY MIND~.  I told one kid that I joined the
Army to pay my way through school and I said I might not make it
through- but I tell them I live ~IN HOPE~."
