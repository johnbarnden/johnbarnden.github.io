Crisis in the Gulf
p. 28
3rd column	1st paragraph
Some troops flew, sitting on equipment crammed into transports, others
went by sea, packed like sardines.  No matter how they got there, they
~KNEW~ the sandpile was waiting there for them.  Cpl. Edward Gregoire,
19, a Marine who came from Hawaii, wrote to his parents saying, "Hey
the Persian Gulf sounds nasty, but it's beautiful, too.  Crystal clear
water.  Dolphins following the boat."  Returning from a flight, Gary
Porterfield, 28, an Air Force pilot wrote: "It's nothing but sand.
One big beach.  I can't ~BELIEVE~ people actually live here."  The place
had a way of bringing out the Omar Khayyam in the most prosaic grunt.
"You should see the night," Army Sp/4 Larry Campbell wrote his wife,
Barbar.  "The sky comes alive with a billion stars and a moon that
seems s bright as a spotlight.  It's like you can see the whole
galaxy."

Title:  `Somebody in Saudi Arabia Loves Me'
Subheader:  THE FAMILIES LEFT BEHIND STRUGGLE TO FILL THE VOID
By:  Barbara Kantrowitz
pg. 33
2nd paragraph
So how are you doing with all this Saudi Arabia s--- that is in the
papers and on the news every day?  Don't ~BELIEVE~ half of the things
they say.  Because it is opinions and speculation.  It's just a bunch
of politicians that don't know what they are talking about.  So don't
even worry about it.
