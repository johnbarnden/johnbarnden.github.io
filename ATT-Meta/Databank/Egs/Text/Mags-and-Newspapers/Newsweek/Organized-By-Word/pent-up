Title:  Looking for Lessons
Subheader:  BOTH PARTIES DECLARED VICTORY- AND THEN PORED OVER THE
	ELECTION RESULTS TO SEE WHAT WENT WRONG 
bottom of pg. 36	2nd column	1st paragraph

3rd column	1st paragraph
LONG SHOTS:  If so, the politicians are fighting the last war.  It's
always senseless to sell long shots short, but besides Nebrska Gov.
Bob Kerrey, that's exactly what's happening.  Names like Florida Sen.
Bob Graham and Colorado Sen. Tim Wirth haven't even been floated, and
it's not so early anymore.  Of course with so much of the ~PENT-UP
DEMAND~ for reform ~THWARTED~ this year, 1992 could be the year when a
real outsider storms up the barricades.  Who?  Think Colin Powell (who
won't reveal his party ID), Ralph Nader, Ted Turner, ex-drug-czar
William Bennettt (yes, a Democrat).  If they're unbearable, think some
more.
