Crisis in the Gulf
pg.29		1st column	3rd paragraph
The banter made everyone feel better in the early phases of the
military buildup; but as the psy-war in the gulf threated to become
the real thing, the mood changed.  David Martin, 19, of the 101
Airborne, wrote his sister Kelley that he and his buddy, Ray were the
two forward-most Americans at the front:  nothing but Saudis ahead of
them.  Mail arrived every three days, by truck and by chopper.  As
time passed, david told kelley, he began to feel "a ~SENSE~ of momentum
toward a clash....lots of movement, lots of equipment."  He was an
easygoing guy- he wrote his letters on Garfield the Cat stationery
imprinted, "If life is a bridge to be crossed, let's dawdle all we
can" - but he confessed to his sister that he got "more and more
nervous every day."
