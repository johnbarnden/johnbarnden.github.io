All the same, Cuomo remains the darling of the pundit class.  The
latest guess is that the %million left over from his gubernatorial war
chest is evidence that he's running.  This, of course, ~ASSUMES~ another
bit of conventional thinking- that big money is essential.  In 1990,
anyway, that wasn't always the case.  Bradley's opponent, Christine
Whitman, was outspent 12 to 1.  Ann Richards in Texas and Lawton
Chiles in Florida lost the fund-raising race but won anyway.  Beyond a
certain level necessary for maintaining a presence on the air, money
is mostly a way for reporters and other insiders to keep score.
