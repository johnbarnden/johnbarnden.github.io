Title:  Moscow's Two-Edged Plowshare, pg. 25
Subheader:  THE SOVIET UNION GAINS A FOOTHOLD IN THE GULF
2nd paragraph to bottom of pg. 30
Somewhere south of Kuwait, the Third Battalion of the 11th Marines is
dug into desert trenches, its 155-mm howitzers ready to deliver
supporting fire for a tank assault or amphibious invasion.  At sunup,
Marines crowd around the tailgate of a truck for mail call.  In the
heat and dust of the outpost, letters become tattered and stained.
Capt. Jerry Sneed carries in his pocket a creased sheet from his son.
It has a drawing of the Marine Corps War Memorial- the flag raising on
Iwo Jima- and the words "To Dad.  You make me proud Dad.  Jeremy."
OFF TO THE SIDE, PFC. JOHN DUGGAN HOPES FOR WORD FROM HIS FIANCEE
KATHRYN REDMAN.  They were engaged three days before he was sent to
Saudi Arabia.  "I'M IN LOVE, I CAN'T THINK ABOUT ANYTHING ELSE," HE
SAYS.  "I FEEL TOTALLY EMPTY.  I live in a hole in the ground and the
only thing that helps me to pass the time is her letters," he syas.
He writes her constantly.  One time he pulled some hair off his chest
and sent it to her.  She sent him back a strand of her hair.  Then he
sent her those desert weeds and an impassioned audiotape.  "It was
like he was right here," she says.  "At the end of the tape I was
hugging the speaker next to me."
