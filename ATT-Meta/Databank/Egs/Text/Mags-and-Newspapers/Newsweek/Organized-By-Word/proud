Title:  Letters in the Sand

pg. 30
3rd column	1st paragraph
Mail alone cannot neutralize the Vietnam syndrome, but it helps.
Marine Staff Sgt. William Fitgerald, 30, was too young for Vietnam.
When he joined the corps 11 years ago, he heard Viet vets telling
horror stories all the time.  "They'd get letters from home, sure," he
says.  "But the media, the war protesters, even some of the
politicians were telling them they were doing the wrong thing, they
were murderers, they were on their own."  Now he gets letters from a
nun in Philadelphia who had eight brothers in World War II.  "She told
me she was ~PROUD~ of what we were doing, and cared for us and- with a
name like Fitzgerald, to say a rosary if I was Catholic."  He heard his
son say "Papa" for the first time when his wife, Carole, sent him an
audiotape.  Determined that the American soldier won't be forgotten
this time, she has distributed 2,000 aluminum bracelets marked "1990-
"Til our Fighting Forces Return."  She has also written to President
Bush, saying, "We ~WANT~ people to ~REMEMBER~ when they start complaining
about the price of gas to ~THINK~ of the people who are putting their
lives on the line."
