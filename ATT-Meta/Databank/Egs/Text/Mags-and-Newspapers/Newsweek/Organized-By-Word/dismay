2nd column	1st paragraph
Last week Secretary of State James Baker talked with Shevardnadze for
13 hours at President Mikhail Gorbachev's dacha outside Moscow.  THE
AMERICANS SAID GORBACHEV WAS DISMAYED BY PRIMAKOV'S LACK OF SUCCESS
WITH SADDAM.  ACCORDING TO SOVIET SOURCES, SADDAM WAS WILLING TO
CONSIDER A COMPROMISE SETTLEMENT, UNDER WHICH HE MIGHT ULTIMATELY
OBTAIN TWO KUWAITI ISLANDS AND CONTROL OVER A DISPUTED OILFIELD.  BUT
HE WAS NOT WILLING TO START THE PROCESS BY COMPLETELY WITHDRAWING HIS
FORCES FROM THE EMIRATE, AS DEMANDED BY THE INTERNATIONAL COALITION
ARRAYED AGAINST HIM.
