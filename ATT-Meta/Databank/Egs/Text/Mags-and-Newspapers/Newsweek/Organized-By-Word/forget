	ELECTION RESULTS TO SEE WHAT WENT WRONG

PHONE HOME:  Like nagging moms, voters in several states nudged their
wayward sons to visit more often and stop being such big shots.  New
York Gov. Mario Cuomo, who won a less than convincing victory against
a field of nobodies, may have some fence mending ahead of him.  ""We
didn't get that exulant shout that we wanted to hear from the people,"
he admitted afterward.  Bradley, who ran celebritylike ads and
wouldn't deign to discuss taxes, fervently promised the people to
serve out his hardwon third term.  And conservative GOP firebrand Newt
Gingrich, who obviously ~FORGOT~ Thomas P. (Tip) O'Neill's axiom that
"all politics are local," also ~FOUND~ the natives restless.  "People
here want a nice Georgia congressman who will care about their sewer,"
says Kate Head, campaign manager for challenger David Worley, who has
demanded a recount.  By contrast, Democrats Lawton Chiles, who won
Florida's gubernatorial race, and Paul Wellstone, Minnesota's new
senator, ran highly effective grass-roots campaigns.
