pg. 29
3rd column	1st paragraph
Coming off a routine watch on day, Michael N. (Chip) Manns, Jr., 23, a
machinist's mate third class aboard the USS Iwo Jima, wrote his father
about te frustrations aboard a ship jammed with sailors:  "men in my
workspace, men in the chowline, men in the showers, men all around
when I'm sleeping, men, men, men."  He told his mother he stood eight
hours of watch a day, worked eight, then slept four to six hours each
night in the jammed quarters.  "Everything is pretty routine," he
wrote.  "Actually, being over here doesn't bother me that much.  It's
just the waiting.  If we are going to war, I ~WISH~ we could get the
show on the road."  Two weeks later a steam pipe on the Iwo Jima
ruptured.  The blast killed Chip Manns.

pg. 26
3rd paragaph
In millions of letters home, soldiers are writing a foxhole chronicle
of America's showdown with Iraq.  Even though no one is shooting yet,
the mail is full of war stories:  the "Kiss 'em goodbye" alert
stateside, the barf-bag trip to the gulf, the heat, the flies, the
dead camels beyond the defense perimeter, scorpions big as field
mmice, sand vipers slithering through the dunes.  Each day you dig in
deeper, waiting for the balloon to go up.  At night, by flashlight,
you pull out your ballpoint- and ~WISH~ to hell you were home.

Title:  In Peril on the Sea
Tyrone M. Brooks, 19, of Detroit, Mich., died Oct. 30 in a boiler
accident aboard the USS Iwo Jima.  From a letter to his fiancee,
Juanita Smith:
2nd paragraph
I am just fine.  I miss you and the baby a lot.  I ~WISH~ I could be
there to hold both you and her or him.  Did I tell you we have gone
halfway around the world?  I talked to my division officer the other
day, and he said if we are back before you have the baby he will make
sure that I am home for the birth of our child.  You ~KNOW~ how he ~KNOWS~
I am having a child is that he saw you when you came aboard the ship.
Have you talked to my mother since the last time you wrote?  If not,
you better call her so she can know how her daughter-in-law and
grandbaby are doing.  If I am not home when you go into labor, call so
my brother can come to the hospital.  Have you picked out a baby bed
yet?  Are you going to have a baby shower so all your friends can buy
my baby all those nice gifts?  If you need the money to have one, just
tell me how much and when to send it.  Well, I have to go now but
~REMEMBER~ I love you and the baby.  Write me back as soon as you get
this letter.  Let's see if we can keep a steady flow of mail to each
other.  That's all.  P.S. I will buy the baby what you pick out when I
get home.

3rd paragraph
Something about these letters in the sand subverts the conventional
wisdom about what is at risk in the gulf.  Presidents and kings,
diplomats and generals speak the language of geopolitics and global
economics.  To them, the flow of oil is more important than the flow
of mail.  After listening to so much martial rhetoric from the top, it
is a relief to read things like, "Hello, Devil Dog Family," the
salutaton of a dusty Marine.  You worry about what could happen to
these pen pals if war does come, and very little that the top dogs
have to say helps much.  "I ~WISH~ I could help," writes Salome
Welliver, a fourth grader from Kansas City.  "But I'm just a
nine-year-old.  I pray for you and peace.  If war starts you can win.
God bless you."  Every one of you.
