Title:  Moscow's Two-Edged Plowshare
Subheader:  THE SOVIET UNION GAINS A FOOTHOLD IN THE GULF
By:  Russel Watson with Margaret Garrard Warner and Fred Coleman in
	Moscow
2nd paragraph to top of 3rd column

American officials and some Soviet analysts believe Gorbachev has
~CONFLICTING~ objectives.  He wants a partnership with Washington, but
he also wants to make sure that Moscow comes out on the right side of
whatever happens in the gulf.  Since the Crisis began, the Kremlin has
kept up relations with Baghdad, deciding to leave  thousands of
oilfield workers and at least 133 military specialists in Iraq until
their work contracts were completed.  Moscow also has agressively
courted other countries that can help it, economically or politically,
improving its relations with Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Israel.
