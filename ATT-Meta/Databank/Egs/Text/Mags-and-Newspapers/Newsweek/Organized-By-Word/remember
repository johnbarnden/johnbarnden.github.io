Title:  Moscow's Two-Edged Plowshare
Subheader:  THE SOVIET UNION GAINS A FOOTHOLD IN THE GULF
By:  Russel Watson with Margaret Garrard Warner and Fred Coleman in
	Moscow
2nd paragraph
Some hard-liners charge that "Gorbachev and Shevardnadze are
continually yielding to the West without thinking through the Soviet
Union's long-term interests," Kortunov says.  Gorbachev also has to
~REMEMBER~ that if he supports a military crackdown on Saddam, he may
stir up new unrest in his own Muslim republics.  Thus he has to keep
his distance from Washington, even if he agrees with U.S. policy.  The
payoff could be that, once the dust settles, Gorbachev's "good cop"
will be a lot more popular among the Arabs than Bush's tough enforcer.

Title:  In Peril on the Sea
Tyrone M. Brooks, 19, of Detroit, Mich., died Oct. 30 in a boiler
accident aboard the USS Iwo Jima.  From a letter to his fiancee,
Juanita Smith:
2nd paragraph
I am just fine.  I miss you and the baby a lot.  I ~WISH~ I could be
there to hold both you and her or him.  Did I tell you we have gone
halfway around the world?  I talked to my division officer the other
day, and he said if we are back before you have the baby he will make
sure that I am home for the birth of our child.  You ~KNOW~ how he ~KNOWS~
I am having a child is that he saw you when you came aboard the ship.
Have you talked to my mother since the last time you wrote?  If not,
you better call her so she can know how her daughter-in-law and
grandbaby are doing.  If I am not home when you go into labor, call so
my brother can come to the hospital.  Have you picked out a baby bed
yet?  Are you going to have a baby shower so all your friends can buy
my baby all those nice gifts?  If you need the money to have one, just
tell me how much and when to send it.  Well, I have to go now but
~REMEMBER~ I love you and the baby.  Write me back as soon as you get
this letter.  Let's see if we can keep a steady flow of mail to each
other.  That's all.  P.S. I will buy the baby what you pick out when I
get home.

Title:  Letters in the Sand

pg. 30
3rd column	1st paragraph
Mail alone cannot neutralize the Vietnam syndrome, but it helps.
Marine Staff Sgt. William Fitgerald, 30, was too young for Vietnam.
When he joined the corps 11 years ago, he heard Viet vets telling
horror stories all the time.  "They'd get letters from home, sure," he
says.  "But the media, the war protesters, even some of the
politicians were telling them they were doing the wrong thing, they
were murderers, they were on their own."  Now he gets letters from a
nun in Philadelphia who had eight brothers in World War II.  "She told
me she was ~PROUD~ of what we were doing, and cared for us and- with a
name like Fitzgerald, to say a rosary if I was Catholic."  He heard his
son say "Papa" for the first time when his wife, Carole, sent him an
audiotape.  Determined that the American soldier won't be forgotten
this time, she has distributed 2,000 aluminum bracelets marked "1990-
"Til our Fighting Forces Return."  She has also written to President
Bush, saying, "We ~WANT~ people to ~REMEMBER~ when they start complaining
about the price of gas to ~THINK~ of the people who are putting their
lives on the line."
