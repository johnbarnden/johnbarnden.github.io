Title:  Looking for Lessons
Subheader:  BOTH PARTIES DECLARED VICTORY- AND THEN PORED OVER THE
	ELECTION RESULTS TO SEE WHAT WENT WRONG 
pg. 34
3rd paragraph to top of 2nd column
No one ~FELT~ greater pressure to draw lessons from the results than
Bush, since the vote was clearly a referendum on him, too.  Two days
after the elections, he invited several of his closest outside
advisers to an East Wing lunch.  His first question:  "Where can I
improve?"  (Anyone who ~THOUGHT~ the answer was to fire John Sununu held
his tongue since the chief of staff was also present.)  Bush also
announced a new no-tax pledge, saying that next time Democrats would
have to raise income tax rates "over my dead veto."  Congressmen, too,
will probably take last week's close calls as a mandate for cowardice:
running scared, they are less likely than ever to step out in front of
difficult issues, or to reform a process that protects their seats.
But there are risks in playing safe.  "Americans are very ~ANGRY AND
CYNICAL~ about the system," says GOP pollster Richard Wirthlin.  "They
~THINK~ government is simply not governing."
