There aren't many statesmen who have discussed the Persian Gulf Crisis
in depth with both George Bush and Saddam Hussein.  One who has,
Soviet envoy Yevgeny Primakov, has become a professional optimist.  "I
am ~CONFIDENT~ that a peaceful solution is possible," he said last week
during a receptin in the Kremlin.  Soviet sources concede that after
two sessions with the ubiquitous primakov last month, saddam shows no
sign of actual movement toward a compromise.  Even so, the role of
peacemaker has paid off handsomely for Primakov and for the Kremlin.
