Title:  `Somebody in Saudi Arabia Loves Me'
Subheader:  THE FAMILIES LEFT BEHIND STRUGGLE TO FILL THE VOID
By:  Barbara Kantrowitz
pg. 33
2nd column	1st paragraph
~HANDLING~ these familly tensions requires some ingenuity.  Carolyn
Dove, principal of the Wassom Middle School, received a particularly
heartbreaking letter from a single parent, Staff Sgt. Leila Jordan,
who was distraught because she had not heard from her children,
Christopher, 13, and Daniel, 3.  Jordan signed the letter:  "Parent
always.  Even so far away."  The children were healthy (an aunt was
looking after them); the problem was unreliable mail service in the
early days.  But Dove, ~MOVED~ by the letter, ~DECIDED~ to make sure
Jordan and her children kept in touch.  Twice a week, Christopher
comes to her office and, under her supervision, writes to his mother.
