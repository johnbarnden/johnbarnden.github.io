Subheader:  THE SOVIET UNION GAINS A FOOTHOLD IN THE GULF
pg.29		1st column	3rd paragraph
The banter made everyone feel better in the early phases of the
military buildup; but as the psy-war in the gulf threated to become
the real thing, the mood changed.  David Martin, 19, of the 101
Airborne, wrote his sister Kelley that he and his buddy, Ray were the
two forward-most Americans at the front:  nothing but Saudis ahead of
them.  Mail arrived every three days, by truck and by chopper.  AS
TIME PASSED, DAVID TOLD KELLEY, HE BEGAN TO FEEL "A SENSE OF MOMENTUM
TOWARD A CLASH....LOTS OF MOVEMENT, LOTS OF EQUIPMENT."  He was an
easygoing guy- he wrote his letters on Garfield the Cat stationery
imprinted, "If life is a bridge to be crossed, let's dawdle all we
can" - but he confessed to his sister that he got "more and more
nervous every day."

Crisis in the Gulf
p.29
4th paragraph to top of 2nd column
Others felt the same way.  Herbert Plummer, 21, a paratrooper, wrote
his mother to say that some nights he couldn't sleep "because of my
fear of this place."  He didn't ~KNOW~ why, but "being in this country
makes me so jumpy i can almost ~FEEL~ as if someone is watching me.  No
lie!"  At other outposts, dead camels beyond the defense perimeters
made the desert stink.  A fire incinerated one unit's mailroom.
Nerves tautened.  Even friends grew edgy.  Then, each evening just
after dark, Baghdad Betty, Saddam Hussein's answer to Tokyo Rose, got
on the radio to work on them.  "She tells us we're going to die and
Iraqi worms are going to eat us," Army Sgt. Eric Petersen reported to
his wife, Maryann.  "Pretty awful, huh?"

2nd paragraph to bottom of pg. 30
Somewhere south of Kuwait, the Third Battalion of the 11th Marines is
dug into desert trenches, its 155-mm howitzers ready to deliver
supporting fire for a tank assault or amphibious invasion.  At sunup,
Marines crowd around the tailgate of a truck for mail call.  In the
heat and dust of the outpost, letters become tattered and stained.
Capt. Jerry Sneed carries in his pocket a creased sheet from his son.
It has a drawing of the Marine Corps War Memorial- the flag raising on
Iwo Jima- and the words "To Dad.  You make me proud Dad.  Jeremy."
Off to the side, Pfc. John Duggan ~HOPES~ for word from his fiancee
Kathryn Redman.  They were engaged three days before he was sent to
Saudi Arabia.  "I'm in love, I can't ~THINK~ about anything else," he
says.  "I ~FEEL TOTALLY EMPTY~.  I live in a hole in the ground and the
only thing that helps me to pass the time is her letters," he syas.
He writes her constantly.  One time he pulled some hair off his chest
and sent it to her.  She sent him back a strand of her hair.  Then he
sent her those desert weeds and an impassioned audiotape.  "It was
like he was right here," she says.  "At the end of the tape I was
hugging the speaker next to me."

Title:  Looking for Lessons
Subheader:  BOTH PARTIES DECLARED VICTORY- AND THEN PORED OVER THE
	ELECTION RESULTS TO SEE WHAT WENT WRONG 
pg. 34
3rd paragraph to top of 2nd column
No one ~FELT~ greater pressure to draw lessons from the results than
Bush, since the vote was clearly a referendum on him, too.  Two days
after the elections, he invited several of his closest outside
advisers to an East Wing lunch.  His first question:  "Where can I
improve?"  (ANYONE WHO THOUGHT THE ANSWER WAS TO FIRE JOHN SUNUNU HELD
HIS TONGUE SINCE THE CHIEF OF STAFF WAS ALSO PRESENT.)  Bush also
announced a new no-tax pledge, saying that next time Democrats would
have to raise income tax rates "over my dead veto."  Congressmen, too,
will probably take last week's close calls as a mandate for cowardice:
running scared, they are less likely than ever to step out in front of
difficult issues, or to reform a process that protects their seats.
But there are risks in playing safe.  "AMERICANS ARE VERY ANGRY AND
CYNICAL ABOUT THE SYSTEM," SAYS GOP POLLSTER RICHARD WIRTHLIN.  "They
think government is simply not governing."
