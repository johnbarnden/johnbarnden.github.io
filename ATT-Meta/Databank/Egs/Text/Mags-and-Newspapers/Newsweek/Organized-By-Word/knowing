Section:  Crisis in the Gulf
Title:  Letters in the Sand
bottom of pg. 28
1st column	1st paragraph
The grunts now on alert in the gulf are members of a volunteer army,
not draftees like those who served at the peak of the Vietnam War.
When orders were cut for the gulf, the first impulse of most of them
was gung ho.  "Remember this," Preston Coffer, 24, a Marine corporal,
wrote to friends in Texas.  "We are talking about Marines, not the Boy
Scouts.  We all joined the service ~KNOWING~ full well what might be
expected of us."  And he signed off "Semper Fi."  Others felt similar
pangs.  Adrian Ingraham, 20, paratrooper in the 82nd Airborne, was the
youngest of three Ingraham sons ordered to the Middle East.  "Momma,
Daddy, we all have jobs to do," he wrote home.  He told them not to
ask the Army to reassign him if Oswald, 34, or Irwin, 22, is killed.
Then he headed out.  "If something should happen to me," he wrote, "my
will is in my wall locker at Fort Bragg.  Room 211.  I didn't have
time to send it home."
