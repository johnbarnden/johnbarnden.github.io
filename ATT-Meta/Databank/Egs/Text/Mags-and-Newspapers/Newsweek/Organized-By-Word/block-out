Title:  `Somebody in Saudi Arabia Loves Me'
Subheader:  THE FAMILIES LEFT BEHIND STRUGGLE TO FILL THE VOID
By:  Barbara Kantrowitz
pg. 33
4th paragraph
As the weeks pass, most of the families have tried to establish a
routine that ~BLOCKS OUT~ thoughts of the desert.  But it isn't easy.
With the threat of war so close, even routine occasions take on added
significance.  Last week the students at Mahaffey Middle School made
patriotism the theme of their fall concert.  Most of the students wore
red, white and blue clothes to school.  The few that didn't had T
shirts or sweat shirts with special messages.  One girl's read:
"Someone in Saudi Arabia loves me."  Any one of them could have worn
it; virtually all have at least one parent in the gulf.  The concert
concluded with "America the Beautiful" -all three verses.  The
school's slide projector flashed the lyrics on a screen so the
audience could sing along.  But in this crowd, there was no need.
Everyone already knew the words.

METAPHOR MIND AS A CONTAINER
