Title:  `Somebody in Saudi Arabia Loves Me'
Subheader:  THE FAMILIES LEFT BEHIND STRUGGLE TO FILL THE VOID
By:  Barbara Kantrowitz
top of pg. 33		1st column	1st paragraph
Years ago the Army didn't ~WORRY~ too much about the problems of spouses
and children on the home front.  There's an old saying:  if the Army
~WANTED~ you to have a wife, it would have issued you one.  That
attitude is a luxury the all-volunteer Army can no longer afford.
Attracting career soldiers means provodomg for their families as well.
At Fort Campbell, there are seven schools for 4,000 students from the
elementary grades through high school, a childcare center, financial
and emotional counseling services- even a woodworking class to teach
wives how to make home repairs while their husbands are away.

Title:  Looking for Lessons
Subheader:  BOTH PARTIES DECLARED VICTORY- AND THEN PORED OVER THE
	ELECTION RESULTS TO SEE WHAT WENT WRONG 
pg. 34

1st column	2nd paragraph
In truth, the results were so mied that both parties had reason to
~WORRY~.  Despite predictions of an insurgency at the polls, voters
returned 96 percent of congressional incumbents seeking re-election.
But they gave a number of key figures unexpectedly slim margins:
popular two-term Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey nearly lost to an
unknown challenger, and Minority Whip Newt Gingrich almost found
himself on a midnight train to Georgie- without a job.  The Democrats
cemented their hold over Congress with a probable gain of eight House
seats- not enough to override a presidential veto but more than enough
to make the White House squirm- and solidified their place in the sun,
taking the Florida and Texas statehouses.  But the GOP won the big
one- California- and made serious inroads throughout the rust belt.
Overall, the Democrats will be well situated to expand their
congressional majorities when state legislatures begin redistricting
next year.
