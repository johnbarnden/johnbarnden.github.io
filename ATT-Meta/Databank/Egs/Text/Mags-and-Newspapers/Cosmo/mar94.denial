((START OF ARTICLE))

  Indulgence defines Katie's life. Despite a talent for catering and a keen
business sense, the thirty-two-year-old chooses to work just enough to make
rent and expenses. She spends the rest of her time drinking to the point of
blackouts, as well as consuming drugs and food with equal abandon and
sleeping with whomever will have her.  This excess has taken its toll, not only
on health, career, and reputation, but on her relationships with family and
friends. Don't tell her that, however. As far as she's concerned, her life is
nothing but fun. "I'm having a great time," she insists.

  Only on occasion does Katie's front crack---when, say, she mentions the
marriage and children she's always wanted, a goal that has eluded her so far.
But she doesn't dwell on such notions. They're too painful, and she's not ready
to handle the self-doubt they engender. So she (* ENTOMBS ALL NEGATIVE THOUGHTS *)
and deludes herself into believing her existence is everything she wants it to
be.

  In Katie's case, denial has not only defined her life; it has limited it. Yet
denial isn't always destructive. In times of crisis, it allows us to function
by (* SHIELDING US FROM INTERNAL PAIN.*) And researchers have found that, on
average, seriously ill patients who minimize the severity of their condition or
the gravity of impending surgery have a better prognosis for recovery than
those who focus on the grimmer possibilities. On a wider scale, denial allows
us to ignore unpleasant realities (like the odds of our being in a car
accident) and carry on. "In order to survive in the world without being afraid
all the time, people walk around with a lot of self-deception," says Los
Angeles psychologist Michael Greenwald.

  Unfortunately, however, while denial may get us through the day, it crops up
more frequently as a self-defeating coping mechanism. Whether triggered by our
not wanting to acknowledge our shortcomings or by our not wanting to (*
CONFRONT OUR FEARS *), (* SELF-DELUSION __CAN__[ital.] BE A REAL STUMBLING
BLOCK TO HAPPINESS, *) according to Robert McGrath, associate professor of
psychology at Fairleigh Dickinson University.

  Avoiding the pitfalls of self-delusion isn't easy, since most people who are
(* IN THE MIDST OF DENIAL *) don't realize it. So how can you tell if you are? The
signs include consistently making excuses, keeping yourself so busy that you
never have any quiet time, chronic irritability, fatigue, unhappiness, jumping
from relationship to relationship, and refusing to listen to those who know
you best when they're all saying the same thing. Feeling (* YOUR DEFENSES
SKYROCKET *) or lashing out in anger at someone you respect may also signal a
problem, as can the inability to recognize how people affect or hurt you or
how your own actions impact on or cause pain to others. Finally, and perhaps
most important, if you suddenly find yourself isolated from all the people
you've been closest to, you might want to (* ASK YOURSELF *) why.

  Being able to identify a few of those cues could have helped Geri avoid a
good deal of pain. A month had gone by since the twenty-nine-year-old lawyer's
Christmas fling. Her affair with Stephen, a ski instructor/musician, hadn't
been perfect, but her memory of it was fond. Yet when he invited himself for a
lengthy visit, (* HER NERVE ENDINGS SPARKED LIKE FRAYED WIRES.*) What (* NAGGED
AT HER *) was his use of cocaine, which, to make herself feel better, she
classified as recreational.

  When Stephen moved in, the relationship began to deteriorate. The job he
promised to get never materialized.  Geri rationalized supporting him as a
temporary state of affairs. It was harder to (* FACE WHY *) they suddenly weren't
having sex. But adventure, conversation, music, and laughter marked the initial
weeks they spent together, and Stephen's presence replaced the loneliness
that Geri had only just begun to recognize.

  As the months went by, Geri chose not to (* SEE *) what was so obvious to everyone
around her. She overlooked the large quantities of liquor Stephen drank, and
she accepted the stories he told to explain his unpredictable absences. She
blamed herself for the lack of intimacy and questioned her own grasp of reality
when his lies contradicted events she knew to be true. Yet despite her
increasing uneasiness, she dismissed the concerns of friends and family and
argued with anyone who suggested her life had gone to hell. It took the
discovery of a bloody syringe under her bathroom sink to (* SHATTER HER DENIAL *)
of Stephen's drug problem and of the nightmare she'd bought into.

  Emotional investment in a relationship often (* BLINDS US *) to those elements
that (* DON'T FIT THE SCENARIO WE'VE CONSTRUCTED IN OUR MIND.*) But people
also replace reality with illusion when their psychic pain seems too much to
bear, according to Susan Brace, a clinical psychologist in West Los Angeles.

  (* TAKE PAM.*) For years after her older brother, a onetime high-school football
star, was diagnosed with schizophrenia, she believed some day he would
suddenly get well. Though she'd taken

                           -190-

plenty of college psych courses and heard enough from the doctors to know the
chances of his ever again living a normal life were poor, she refused to accept
that her brother's condition was chronic. "(* I KEPT THINKING, [INT UTT] Maybe
this drug or that shrink will cure him *)," says Pam. "By denying the reality,
I could (* PUT MY FEELINGS OF HOPELESSNESS AND HELPLESSNESS ON HOLD *) AND not
really deal with them."

  Under particularly threatening or stressful conditions, denial can actually
graduate into repression, where there's absolutely no conscious perception of
reality. For Eileen Franklin, that moment of repression came at the age of
eight, when she witnessed her father murder her best friend. For twenty years,
(* SHE BURIED THE IMAGE *) of his bashing in eight-year-old Susan Nason's head
with a rock. (* THAT IMAGE REMAINED LOCKED AWAY *) until a quizzical look in
her own daughter's eyes reminded her of Susan's final expression and caused the
horrible memory to (* FLOOD INTO COGNIZANCE.*)

  Even in less extreme cases, "people frequently deny what parents have done that
was hurtful," says Rebecca Curtis, a New York clinical psychologist and
professor of psychology at Adelphi University. "We all want to maintain the
view that our parents are good."  In order to cope emotionally, children who
are mistreated often (* SUPPRESS THEIR CONSCIOUS KNOWLEDGE *) of any damaging
actions. This is especially true when those actions arise from incest. "Denial
and dissociation [are] the two defensive modes that are typically central in
the effort to cope with and defend against the lasting consequences of bodily
abuse," say therapists William F.  Cornell and Karen A. Olio in the __American
Journal of Orthopsychiatry__[ital.].

  They could have been talking about Marilyn Van Derbur Alter. Four years after
being crowned Miss America, the radiant blonde finally came to terms with her
millionaire father's sexual abuse of her from the time she was five until she
turned eighteen and went away to college. When she was young, she said nothing
because she "perceived no way out," she says. "In order to survive, (* I SPLIT
INTO A DAY CHILD *...) who giggled and smiled (...* AND A NIGHT CHILD *) who
lay awake in a fetal position, only to be pried apart by my father. Until I was
twenty-four, the day child had no conscious knowledge of the night child."
Only when her former minister voiced the suspicion that she had been abused did
(* THE REALITY OF THE NIGHT CHILD EMERGE.*)

  Though (* INCEST HAS COLORED EVERY ASPECT OF HER LIFE *...), from her (...*
DRIVE *...) to overachieve to her (...* FEAR *) of physical and emotional
intimacy, (* MARILYN'S BRAIN HAD UNWITTINGLY SHIELDED HER FROM THE TRAUMA.*)
Consequently, she felt no anger toward her father while growing up, "because I
had no conscious knowledge of what he was doing to me."

  "For a child, social validation of thoughts and feelings is very dependent on
external validation," says Marc Sadoff, a clinical social worker and board
member of the California chapter of the National Council for Sexual Addictions.
"The more a problem is denied, the more its impact multiplies." And certainly
dysfunctional families with destructive tendencies toward physical, sexual, or
substance abuse provide (* FERTILE GROUND FOR THE PROMULGATION OF
SELF-DECEPTION.*)

  Despite its frequently negative consequences, the skill of denying
actuality is one that we all share. Indeed, recent studies suggest that in
certain situations, self-deception occurs naturally in the brain.  "(*
INFORMATION IS FILTERED AND CAN BE CENSORED *) prior to (* ITS ARRIVAL IN OUR
AWARENESS *) ...," says Daniel Goleman, the __New York Times__[ital.]'s
psychology writer and author of __Vital Lies, Simple Truths__[ital.]. "This (*
MENTAL CENSORSHIP *) is possible because (* THE BRAIN CONTINUOUSLY SORTS
THROUGH *...) an immense amount of irrelevant (...* INFORMATION *), (* LETTING
INTO AWARENESS ONLY A NARROW SLICE *) of what is available."

   Many of us use our skill for denial to (* BLOT OUT PAINFUL KNOWLEDGE *)
about ourselves in order to maintain a positive self-image, according to
psychologist C. R. Snyder, coauthor of __Excuses: Masquerades in Search of
Grace__[ital.].  Rather than (* CONFRONT A WEIGHT GAIN *), we'll simply avoid the
scale and any full-length mirrors in the bathroom. On the job, we'll make
excuses to explain why our work wasn't acceptable or blame someone else rather
than address our own inadequacies.

  Denial can also play a salient role among those individuals
whose sexual preference defies convention. A woman may deny her lesbianism not
only to others but to herself as well if she feels enough social pressure.
Studies have shown that gay men and women develop different rationalizations
in order to avoid dealing with their sexual identities, even justifying
same-sex erotic encounters as simply an extension of a special friendship.
Such distinctions then permit them to avoid the implications of any feelings
and actions that might otherwise prove disturbing.

  Whatever the reason, some truths are just too hard for us to accept. "There
may be (* A FLICKER OF RECOGNITION, BUT IT'S SNUFFED OUT *) immediately," says
Los Angeles psychologist Susan Brace.  "(* DARKNESS IS PREFERABLE TO
THREATENING SELF-AWARENESS *) or to the loss of something we're not ready to
let go of---whether it be the man in our life or self-soothing behavior like
gambling or substance abuse."

  That was the case with Anne. After Six years and two kids, her marriage to
Kyle was beginning to run into trouble. His irritability was punctuated by
two-hour trips to the video store and private phone calls at all hours. Then
one day, while doing the laundry, Anne found a recent ticket stub in her
husband's pocket; he'd never mentioned taking in a show. "If any of my
girlfriends had told me a similar story, I would've asked if they were sure
their mate wasn't seeing someone else," says Anne. "Instead, (* I JUST KEPT
SAYING, [INT. UTT???] `This is the thin part of the
__through-thick-and-thin__[ital.] section of our wedding vows.'*)"

  (* IN THE FAR REACHES OF HER MIND *), Anne knew Kyle was having an affair,
but "to acknowledge the betrayal would mean I'd have to take a stand. I'd never
be able to go back to what I was familiar with," she says. Not until eight
months had passed and she finally checked the phone bill did (* ANNE CONFRONT
THE REALITY *) of her husband's deception.

  In many cases, (* self-destructive patterns *...) engendered by denial can
actually prove tougher to (...* FACE *) than (* THE PROBLEMS THAT SPAWNED
THEM.*) (* TAKE TINA *), who knows she's an alcoholic. She has even managed to
stay sober for months at a time. Yet eventually, she lapses and then drops into
her old habit of hooking up with men who beat her. "If you go back to him,
you're participating in your own homicide," her therapist tells her when Tina
shows up with broken ribs or a black eye. But the thirty-year-old refuses to
accept the connection between her choice of mates and her drinking. "It's
okay," she insists each time. "I'm in control."

  While Tina's brand of self-delusion is unquestionably dangerous, the sort of
denial that affects how or whether we take care of our health can be downright
lethal. Studies show that people frequently deny medical symptoms until
conditions that could have been treated on an outpatient basis require
hospitalization. One thirty-five-year-old woman suffered a heart attack after
ignoring chest pains for a year. In another case. Ivy, twenty-seven, had to
have a complete hysterectomy because of cervical cancer that, had it been
discovered in an early stage, would have simply called for removal of a small
portion of her cervix. But because she'd spent years avoiding the recommended
annual pap smears out of fear for what they might reveal, she lost that option.

                             -192-

  "People are terrified of hospitals and doctors. So they pretend
that nothing's wrong," says psychologist Robert McGrath of Fairleigh Dickinson.
Witness Martha, who for days had felt pains on her right side. Instead of
seeing her doctor for a checkup, however, the thirty-four-year-old attributed
her condition to emotional distress. She was, after all, in the middle of a
divorce. (* DEEP DOWN, though, THE THOUGHT *...) that something serious might be wrong
with her physically was simply too scary to (...* FACE.*) Luckily, she happened to be
visiting her parents the day she collapsed with a ruptured appendix. Had no one
been present to call an ambulance and rush her to the hospital, she would
have died.

  No matter what shape it takes, living with denial entails a lifetime of
avoiding facts, situations, or negative feelings. And while that ultimately
translates into physical and emotional distress for some, others pay the cost
in dollars and cents. "(* BUYING THINGS CAN FILL UP PEOPLE WHO FEEL EMPTY.*)"
says Susan Brace, the L.A. psychologist. "But it never works for long, so they
have to go and do it again." Like Helen, a thirty-two-year-old nurse whose
six-year marriage has fallen apart. She can't stop herself from spending.  She
doesn't usually splurge on wildly expensive items but instead will drop a
hundred dollars at a five-and-dime or pick up a few pairs of sixty-dollar
aerobic shoes when she needs a release. (*[INT. UTT?] If you want it, just get
it, SHE FIGURES, then worry how to pay for it later on.*)

  Not surprisingly, this philosophy has got her into trouble.  Three years ago,
having charged the limit on the four major credit cards she carried, and with
no assets to repay the eighteen thousand dollars of debt she'd accrued, Helen
was forced to declare bankruptcy. But even that didn't register. Though she's
still having to (* CONFRONT THE CONSEQUENCES *) of defaulting on her bills, she
continues to overspend. "When I get into a store, I can't help myself. I just
buy everything," she says.

  Long-term denial can negatively impact not only on emotional well-being but
on physical health too. People who refuse to come to terms with childhood
traumas are more likely to suffer from cancer, hypertension, and ulcers. On the
psychological front, denial can compromise our sense of self even when we
should (and often do) know better.

 (* TAKE NATASHA *), a TV talk-show producer who had worked on dozens of
stories about women involved with married men.  Not one ended happily. Yet none
of that mattered when she met Walt, a plastic surgeon to whom she'd gone for a
consultation. "The red flag went up, but I was lonely," she says. She fell into
bed with him within days and in love within weeks. He said all the right
things: that he wasn't happy with his marriage, that he loved Natasha and would
leave his wife for her. Though she knew the odds of that happening were
marginal, Natasha believed him. (*[INT. UTT.] "I'm different," SHE TOLD
HERSELF.*)

  She wasn't. As the Other Woman, she lived precariously, never knowing if
she'd be alone---as she was on every holiday---whether they'd set off on a
hastily planned outing, or whether she'd be stood up at the last minute yet
again. As the months went by, the (* PSYCHIC PAIN *) grew to almost intolerable
levels.  Unable to perform work, Natasha would lie on her office sofa, afraid
to be away from the phone in case Walt called. She knew she was jeopardizing
her job. Still she hung on.

  "Are you going to make a commitment to me?" she asked Walt when he finally
did leave his wife. His reply? "Let's just take it day by day." No longer able
to refute (* THE TRUTH THAT SHE'D DODGED *) for so long, Natasha hurled her
remote control at him and then kicked him out of her house. "I can't believe I
wasted three years of my life," she says. "I hate him so much."

  Those who eventually (* FACE UP TO WHATEVER THEY'VE BEEN DENYING *) usually
do so for one of two reasons: Their life has deteriorated to such an extent
that they're forced to examine why or they feel secure enough to (* EXORCISE
THE GHOSTS.*) Either way, the process frequently requires some sort of therapy.

  When helping people get in touch with their denial, a clinician will often
push the individuals to reexperience totally whatever they're in denial over.
That makes the full impact of the

experience and its repercussions finally register---a crucial step toward
recovery. "You can't (* LET GO OF *) something until you've (* HELD ON TO *) it
for a while and recognized what its presence has meant," says social worker
Marc Sadoff.

  Techniques such as eye-movement desensitization and reprocessing---a
procedure thought to simulate the synthesizing functions of the mind that take
place during rapid-eye-movement sleep---allow individuals to access and
reprocess repressed memories. "The goal is to remember what the event felt like
and then (* INTEGRATE IT WITH THE REST OF CONSCIOUSNESS *)" says Sadoff.
Interventions---where family, friends, and even concerned business associates
unite for a joint confrontation with the person in denial---have also proved
successful.

  Once the problem has been acknowledged, keeping a log of any related thoughts
or behavior can be an effective way to ensure that (* DENIAL DOESN'T CREEP BACK
IN *). Snapping one's wrist with a large rubber band when undesirable (*
NOTIONS COME TO MIND *) can help (* RECHANNEL THINKING.*) In some cases,
self-help groups, in which individuals are (* CONFRONTED BY THE PERCEPTIONS *)
of others, work best, according to John Key, director of Pasadena's Center
Against Abusive Behavior.

  Twelve-step programs have proved particularly successful in this arena. "What
we do is (* METAPHORICALLY HOLD A MIRROR UP TO THE PARTICIPANTS *) and say,
'You see what we see? What are you going to do about it?,"' says Linda, an
Overeaters Anonymous member since 1978. Once the initial (* DENIAL HAS BEEN
CONFRONTED *), the regular self-appraisal that twelve-step programs demand tends
to keep people in check.

  Before Linda joined OA, "I hated myself because I ate, then ate because I
hated myself," she says. Crying jags in department-store dressing rooms would
be followed by oaths never to overeat again. Then she'd go home and binge. The
program forced her to (* CONFRONT WHAT SHE WAS DOING AND WHY *): "For the first
time, I realized not only that I had a problem I couldn't control but that I
couldn't substitute food for living my life."  Sixteen years later, Linda still
attends weekly meetings. Seeing other members (* STRUGGLE TO CONFRONT THEIR
DENIAL *) helps keep her in touch with her own.

  The sooner, of course, that individuals (* CONFRONT WHATEVER REALITY THEY'RE
TRYING TO HIDE FROM *), the better off they'll be, especially when the denial
prevents them from taking action that would improve their lives. This was a
lesson learned by Jamie---if not sooner, then at least not too late. When she
met Denny, Jamie was in debt and tired of working two jobs.  Within the first
few weeks of their knowing each other, he overwhelmed the twenty-five-year-old
cocktail waitress with hundred-dollar tips, long-stemmed roses, limousines, and
jewelry worth thousands. Once they started dating regularly, the gifts got even
more extravagant, culminating in a Mercedes convertible. She married Denny
three months later. Though Jamie knew she was not in love, she'd decided she
was willing to compromise for a lifetime of financial security.

  The price tag for her folly became obvious almost at once.  Verbal barrages
were followed by physical assaults. Denny would try to make up for the abuse
with impressive gifts. apologies, and promises that he'd never be violent
again. Invested in believing he was sincere, Jamie refused to see the pattern.
"I started avoiding my friends. I couldn't really (* FACE WHAT WAS HAPPENING TO
ME *), so I cut myself off from the people who knew me well and might probe too
deeply."

  It took eight years of battering to accept how miserable she really was. "You
live in a million-dollar house in La Jolla, drive a Corvette, have credit cards
at all the best stores and all the money anyone could ever want. You'll never
walk out on me," Denny announced after a particularly brutal encounter. That's
when Jamie finally realized she'd been trying to delude herself into thinking
that everything would be all right. She left the next morning, (* BRUISED [N.B.:
could be physically or mentally] *) but (* BUTTRESSED BY HER RESOLVE *) to quit
the denial and (* FACE THE TRUTH.*)
