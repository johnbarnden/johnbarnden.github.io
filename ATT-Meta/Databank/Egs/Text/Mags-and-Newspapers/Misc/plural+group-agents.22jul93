 "Ottawa Knew Blood Tainted" Toronto Globe and Mail (Canada) (07/20/93), 
  ^^^^^^
P. A1 (Picard, Andre)
     Leading Canadian health officials were aware that HIV-infected 
     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
blood was administered to hemophiliacs more than one year before it 
became necessary to heat-treat blood products to kill the virus, 
according to one of Canada's top AIDS researchers. Michael O'Shaughnessy 
told Radio-Canada that he revealed to   Health and Welfare Canada 
                                        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
officials in July 1984 that his   research demonstrated that 56 percent 
^^^^^^^^^
of hemophiliacs were   infected with HIV.  About a month later, 
O'Shaughnessy said he   spoke about his findings at scientific 
conferences where senior   members of the Health Department and the 
                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Canadian Red Cross were   present.  The disclosure by Dr. O'Shaughnessy, 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
who was then   director of the bureau of laboratory research at the 
Federal   Center for AIDS, is significant in the tainted-blood scandal   
because it adds five months to the critical time period during   which 
Canadians were contracting HIV while federal and provincial  governments 
                                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
and the Red Cross contemplated what should be done.    Dr. 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
O'Shaughnessy's comments also suggest that a number of senior  
                                           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
government officials knew of the issue long before any action was  
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
implemented.  He said that his research findings, part of a   larger 
study that will be published in the New England Journal of  Medicine, 
were known in July 1984, to Alistair Clayton, director   of the Federal 
                            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Center for AIDS; Janice Hopkins of the health   protection branch of 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Health and Welfare Canada; and Norbert   Gilmore, chairman of the 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
National Council on AIDS.
