      [Article about Daniel Day-Lewis playing Lincoln in a new film about
       him.]

 

  To hold on to Lincoln's voice, Mr. Day-Lewis used it all the time,
   between takes and even after the filming was over.

   Jared Harris ... plays General Ulysses S. Grant in the movie. He
   recalled that like other British cast and crew members, he was asked
   not to throw Mr. Day-Lewis off by speaking in a British accent, so
   Mr. Harris too stayed in character.

   "It was sort of an extended improvisation," he said. "It was
   important for him to retain the attitude, if you like, and the
   dialect he had created. So we would sit there and joke, for example,
   about the Vicksburg campaign."

   Mr. Day-Lewis said that he felt a "great sadness" when the movie was
   done and that he still feels connected to it. "I'm woefully
   one-track-minded," he said. "Without sounding unhinged, I know I'm
   not Abraham Lincoln. I'm aware of that. But the truth is the entire
   game is about creating an illusion, and for whatever reason, and mad
   as it may sound, (* some part of me can allow myself to believe, for a
   period of time without questioning,*) and that's the trick." He
   laughed. "Maybe it's a terrible revelation about myself that one
   does feel able to do that."
