from the Sun News, Friday, Feb. 4, 1994, from an article about Judy
Collins:  

Collins said she was a "basket case" in the early '70s.

"I lost custody of my kid, which was very painful and difficult," she
said.  "I got into trouble, primarily alcohol, some drugs.  That was a
very long haul.  I had no idea what was wrong with me.  I knew, but I
kept it a secret from myself or the information didn't get to the
place where it should have gotten.  It was very strange.

"Then I got lucky.  I got that part of my life cleared up.  I got
re-directed, re-focused and I had a lot of luck in terms of my
health."
