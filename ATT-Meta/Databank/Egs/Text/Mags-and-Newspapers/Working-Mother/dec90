FOR INSTANCE, THE COMPUTER-DESIGNED BODY STRUCTURE IS BUILT TO BE
INCREDIBLY RIGID, GIVING YOU THE SECURE FEELING AND QUIET RIDE OF A
MUCH LARGER CAR.

3rd paragraph
In fact, the Mazda Protege actually has more roomfront and rear- than
a Mercedes Benz 190E.

4th paragraph
ALL OF WHICH MAY NOT BE SO SURPRISING WHEN YOU CONSIDER HOW THE
PROTEGE CASTS A SILHOUETTE THAT'S STRIKINGLY SIMILAR TO THOSE OF
BIGGER EUROPEAN FAMILY SEDANS.

5th paragraph
However, the real fun doesn't start until the engine does.  You see,
under the hood beats the heart of a true sports sedan.  Indeed, the
5-speed, 125-horsepower Protege can zip from 0- 60 faster than a BMW
318is.

6th paragraph
WE COULD TELL YOU MORE, BUT FACT AND FIGURES ARE NO SUBSTITUTE FOR
FEELINGS.  Instead, we recommend a visit to your Mazda Dealer.

7th paragraph
Because whether you look at it, sit in it or step on it, the Mazda
Protege is the compact car for people who have had enough of less.

Title:  Political Action, Holiday Peace
By:  Judsen Culbreth

1st column	1st paragraph
MANY OF YOU HAD A STRONG RESPONSE TO OUR SEPTEMBER ARTICLE "WHERE IN
THE WORLD IS CHILD CARE BETTER?"  A mother of two in Hilton, New York,
wrote, "I feel as if I have just had a glass of water thrown in my
face!  I AM ASTOUNDED.  I WAS COMPLETELY BLIND TO WHAT OTHER
INDUSTRIALIZED COUNTRIES ARE DOING FOR THEIR FAMILIES.  The next
letter I write is to my Congressman."  FROM BANDERA, TEXAS, A MOTHER
WITH TWO YOUNG SONS COMMENTED:  IT MAKES ME ANGRY THAT OUR GOVERNMENT
CAN'T (WILL NOT) FIND BETTER MEANS TO PROTECT OUR MOST IMPORTANT
RESOURCE, OUR CHILDREN."  A Gansevoort, New York, reader stated, "I
broke out in goose bumps!  Angry tears came to my eyes when I read
your article.  Children and moms are being so terribly shortchanged by
our 98-percent male Congress!"  AND THIS FROM A MT. WASHINGTON,
KENTUCKY, MOTHER:  "I NEVER THOUGHT I'D SEE THE DAY THAT I WOULD WISH
I LIVED SOMEWHERE OTHER THAN THE UNITED STATES, BUT SWEDEN IS
OBVIOUSLY THE PLACE TO BE FOR WORKING MOTHERS (AND FATHERS).  Fifteen
months of paid, job-protected maternity leave....I am green with
envy."

2nd paragraph
THE ANTIDOTE TO CHILD CARE ENVY IS ACTION.  As we go to press, the
House/Senate Conference considering the child care bill had not
reached an agreement, and the Family and Medical Leave Act, which
guarantees a job-protected maternity leave and which President Bush
vetoed last spring, has been reintroduced in the Senate.  Send
Postcards to Honorable Thomas S. Foley (U.S. House of Representatives,
Washington, DC 20515) and Honorable George Mitchell (U.S. Senate,
Washington, DC 20510)  urging them to support legislation for
affordable, quality care and to pass the Family Medical Leave Act.  If
America's 53.9 million working parents all spoke out on these
important issues, Congress would be forced to listen.

2nd column	1st paragraph
FROM THE POLITICAL FRONT TO THE HOME FRONT- HERE'S A TIP I'VE BEEN
TESTING MYSELF:  WHEN YOU WANT YOUR CHILD TO CHILL OUT, INSTEAD OF
RAISING YOUR VOICE AND YELLING, LOWER IT INSTEAD.  KEEPING COOL
YOURSELF INSTILLS A SENSE OF CALMNESS IN A CHILD.  I DISCOVERED THIS
HELPFUL INT, WHICH WORKS ON MY TWO A FAIR AMOUNT OF THE TIME, IN BETH
THAMES'S ARTICLE "CALM DOWN!"  During the Christmas and Hanukkah
season when even the most mild-mannered children can get overtired and
overtimulated, her peace-producing suggestions are a blessing.

1st column	1st paragraph
Talk about on-site child care!  THE PRODUCERS OF "LIVE WITH REGIS &
KATHIE LEE" WERE SO ANXIOUS TO WELCOME BACK CO-HOST KATHIE LEE GIFFORD
FROM MATERNITY LEAVE THAT THEY TRANSFORMED HER DRESSING ROOM INTO
NURSERY COMPLETE WITH CRIB AND LOVE SEAT.  "I KNOW IT'S A LUXURY A LOT
OF WORKING WOMEN DON'T HAVE," ADMITS GIFFORD, "BUT I'M VERY GRATEFUL."

2nd paragraph
Gifford returned to the show just five weeks after a cesarean
delivery.  SHE HAS A WEEKDAY, LIVE-IN NANNY WHO CARES FOR CODY ON AND
OFF THE SET, AND HER HUSBAND, SPORTS ANALYST FRANK GIFFORD, IS EAGER
TO HELP WHEN HE CAN.  Dad's favorite way to pitch in is to handle the
evening bath.  "I can always tell when Daddy has bathed Cody because
his sleeper is o backwards!"  laughs Gifford.

3rd paragraph
DESPITE LIVE-IN CHILD CARE, GIFFORD HAD DOUBTS ABOUT MANAGING HER BUSY
SCHEDULE, WHICH INCLUDES AN ONGOING CONCERT TOUR WITH CO-HOST REGIS
PHILBIN.  "I WONDERED HOW I WAS GOING TO GET BACK TO A FULL WORK
LOAD," SHE ADMITS, BECAUSE IN THE PAST I WOULD BE SO EXHAUSTED BY
FRIDAY THAT I WOULD COLLAPSE FOR THE ENTIRE WEEKEND."

4th paragraph to top of 2nd column
Now, says Gifford, the promise of spending uninterrupted weekends with
Cody, plus energy she gets from a new exercise routine, is more than
enough to keep her going.  "I THINK THAT PROBABLY A LOT OF WOMEN
NEGLECT THEMSELVES AFTER HAVING A BABY, BUT TELLING A NEW MOM TO
EXERCISE IS THE BEST ADVICE I COULD GIVE HER.  I've got more stamina
now than I ever had."

2nd column	2nd paragraph
Gifford often discusses wuch day-to-day details of her life on the
show, which opens with a freewheeling, 15-minute exchange between the
co-stars.  "Our show is built on the fact that Regis and I talk about
our personal lives, and Cody is the most important thing, next to my
husband, in my life.  So I try to share the funny things that happen.
BUT," SHE ADDS, "THAT MAY GET HARDER TO DO AS CODY GETS OLDER AND SAYS
'MOM, I DON'T WANT YOU SAYING THAT!"  Regis goes through that with his
teenage daughters- they've given him a total gag order!"

Title:  The Hidden Message Behind Gifts
Subheader:  WHAT YOUR MATE CHOOSES CAN REVEAL HOW HE REALLY FEELS
	ABOUT YOU
By:  Linda Lee Small

1st column	1st paragraph
It was Helene's 30th birthday, and her husband, Howard, excitedly led
her into the living room.  "You can open your eyes now," he said.
There in the middle of the floor were golf clubs, unwrapped but tied
with a big satin bow.  All Helene could say was, "Are those for me?"
Howard beamed, but Helene steamed.  A LONGTIME TENNIS PLAYER, SHE HAD
ABSOLUTELY NO INTEREST IN GOLF AND WAS DEFINITELY "TEED OFF."

2nd paragraph
MARYANNE WAS ALSO PRETTY MAD ABOUT HER HUSBAND'S GIFT.  It was an
exercise bike.  She had recently given birth to her second child and
was feeling out of shape.  OBVIOUSLY HER HUSBAND, JIM, FELT THE SAME
WAY ABOUT HER, WAS MARYANNE'S THOUGHT WHEN SHE SAW HER GIFT FOR THEIR
10TH ANNIVERSARY.  She instantly burst into tears.  Every time she
looked at that bike she could "hear" Jim telling her that she needed
to lose weight.

2nd column	1st paragraph
Gifts between spouses deliver potent messages.  "EVERY PRESENT HAS AN
ELEMENT OF THE UNCONSCIOUS IN IT," SAYS LINDA BARBANEL, MSW, A NEW
YORK CITY PSYCHOTHERAPIST.  "IT COULD SAY 'I LOVE YOU,' OR I WANT YOU
TO LOVE ME,' BUT IT COULD ALSO ANNOUNCE 'HERE'S WHAT I REALLY THINK
ABOUT YOU.'  A good gift should say I'm paying attention- I hear
you,'" explains Barbanel.  "IT SHOULD DEMONSTRATE THAT THE GIVER HAS
THOUGHT ABOUT THE RECEIVER."  HOWARD'S AND JIM'S GIFTS BOTH SPOKE
ABOUT THEIR OWN DESIRES.

3rd column	1st paragraph
But the fact is there are often two different interpretations
surrounding one gift:  the message intended by the giver and the one
interpreted by the receiver.  IF WE COULD READ HOWARD'S M IND, HE WAS
PROBABLY THINKING, "I'LL BUY THESE GOLF CLUBS SO HELENE AND I CAN
SPEND MORE TIME TOGETHER."  BUT HELENE'S RESPONSE WAS, "THAT PRESENT
IS FOR HIM- NOT ME."

pg. 16		1st column	1st paragraph
Gerald Piaget, PhD, a member of the clinical faculty of the Department
of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Stanford University Medical
Center, explains how some gift-givers get in trouble:  MOST OF US HAVE
GROWN UP HEARING 'DO UNTO OTHERS AS YOU WOULD HAVE OTHERS DO UNTO
YOU,' BUT THE GOLDEN RULE OF GIFT-GIVING SHOULD BE 'DO UNTO OTHERS AS
OTHERS WOULD HAVE YOU DO UNTO THEM.'"  (IF JIM HAD FOLLOWED THAT
GUIDELINE, HE WOULD HAVE ASKED HIMSELF, "I WONDER IF MARYANNE WOULD
LIKE AN EXERCISE BIKE?")

Subheader:
THE GHOST OF PRESENTS PAST

2nd paragraph
But perhaps there is a more subtle rule to good gift-giving:  "Do unto
others as they are accustomed to being done unto by their families."
WE ALL CARRY INTO OUR MARRIAGES MEMORIES OF HOW OUR FAMILIES
CELEBRATED OCCASIONS, SO IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND YOUR MATE'S
FAMILY HISTORY BEFORE YOU GO OUT SHOPPING.  Take birthdays.  One
family my trot out party favors, balloons and a big cake with candles,
while in another household the day slips by practically unnoticed.
AND WE ALL ARRIVE AT HANUKKAH OR CHRISTMAS WITH MEMORIES INFORMING OUR
EXPECTATIONS.  SO IF YOUR FAMILY TENDED TO "GO FOR BROKE" WITH
EXTRAVAGANT PRESENTS WHILE YOUR MATE COMES FROM THE SCROOGE SCHOOL OF
GIFT-GIVING, THE TWO OF YOU WILL HAVE VERY DIFFERENT FEELINGS ABOUT
WHAT'S APPROPRIATE.

3rd paragraph
ANOTHER ASPECT OF FAMILY TRADITION DICTATES HOW INVOLVED THE RECEIVER
EXPECTS TO BE IN THE PROCESS.  Some mates come from families where the
practice is to all but buy your own gift:  Members drop hints, cut out
pictures of what they want and exchange lists before they exchange
presents.  IN OTHER FAMILIES IT IS CONSIDERED TACKY, INSULTING OR EVEN
GREEDY IF YOU SO MUCH AS DROP A CLUE.  There's no right or wrong way,
just different styles, stresses Michael Berger, PhD, director of the
Atlanta Institute for Family Studies in Georgia.  "But you have to
recognize the need to accommodate your partner," Berger says.
"Gift-giving is just one of the myriad ways our mate differs from us.
But we can still love each other."  And give each other appropriate
gifts.

4th paragraph to top of 2nd column
Take Rhonda and Bob.  Rhonda, a fundraiser from Atlanta, comes from a
small family that always made a big deal over birthdays and holidays,
and she continues that tradition in her own home.  SHE LOVES THE
PROCESS:  "I GET REAL PLEASURE FROM ALL THAT GOES INTO IT- PLANNING
THE GIFT, BUYING IT, WRAPPING IT, HIDING IT.  And I get a good feeling
when my husband likes the gift."  Yet Rhonda hands Bob a list for him
to select her gift from.  IT'S NOT THAT SHE DOESN'T LIKE SURPRISES;
IT'S THAT BOB COMES FROM A LARGE FAMILLY IN WHICH ALL THE MEMBERS MADE
THEIR WISHES KNOWN AND TREATED GIFT-GIVING AS A CHORE.  BOB GETS VERY
NERVOUS IF HE HAS TO CHOOSE A PRESENT FOR RHONDA BY HIMSELF.  SHE
UNDERSTANDS, SO SHE HELPS HIM OUT.

Subheader:
A FOR EFFORT

2nd column	1st paragraph
CLEARLY, THE THOUGHT THAT GOES INTO THE PRESENT COUNTS.  For some
receivers the process plays a big part in the message.

2nd paragraph
MOST PEOPLE ARE PLEASED WHEN THEY ARE ON THE RECEIVING END OF A GIFT
THE GIVER KNEW THEY WANTED.  Barbara, an educator in Westport,
Connecticut, has shared over 37 Hanukkahs with her husband, Jules.
She warmly recalls one of their first:  "We were shopping for a winter
coat and I found one I loved, but it wasn't in my size.  Jules copied
the name of the manufacturer when I wasn't looking, tracked down the
coat in another city and presented it to me for the first night of
Hanukkah.  I've owned more expensive coats, but none has ever meant as
much.  I wore that coat for years and years."

3rd paragraph
LIKE BARBARA, MOST OF US APPRECIATE GIFTS THAT SAY "IT TOOK TIME AND
THOUGHT TO FIND ME."  THE GIFT NOT ONLY SENDS A LOVING MESSAGE, BUT
THERE IS SOME SATISFACTION IN KNOWING THAT THE MESSENGER (A.K.A. OUR
MATE) BATTLED FIGURATIVE HAIL AND SLEET, OR JUST LONG LINES AT THE
CHECKOUT COUNTER, TO CAPTURE IT.

4th paragraph
However, there's a message not only in the effort a gift required but
in the method by which it was given.  Sarah, an editor, showed her
husband, Steve, the new green leather pants she'd bought:  "He knew
that this was a real splurge for me.  I happened to mention that the
pants had a matching jacket, but I couldn't afford it right now."
SARAH ORGOT ALL ABOUT IT UNTIL A FEW DAYS LATER WHEN SHE OPENED HER
CLOSET AND THERE WAS THE JACKET HANGING OVER THE PANTS.  Steve really
hates shopping, so Sarah gives him high marks for not only tracking
down the jacket, but hiding it in her closet so she could stumble onto
it in surprise.

THE PERSONAL TOUCH

5th paragraph to top of 3rd column
Good gifts are rarely "one size fits all."  ACCORDING TO ROBERTA
BUMBERG, PHD, A THERAPIST IN NEW YORK CITY, "WE ENJOY GETTING PRESENTS
THAT REFLECT A RECOGNITION OF OUR STYLE, AND WHICH INDICATE THAT THE
PERSON CHOSE IT JUST FOR US."  Dr. Bumberg offers as an example the
husband who had a saddle designed for his equestrian wife.  WHETHER
IT'S RIDING HORSEBACK, READING MYSTERIES OR LISTENING TO THE OPERA,
YOUR INTEREST IS A KEY TO THE KIND OF PRESENT YOU'D LIKE.  A BAD
CHOICE MAKES YOU FEEL YOU OPENED UP A PRESENT THAT WAS MEANT FOR
SOMEONE ELSE.

3rd column	2nd paragraph
GOOD GIVERS ALSO RECOGNIZE THE MANY FACES, AND FACETS, OF THEIR MATES:
SERIOUS AND FRIVOLOUS, DOWN-TO-EARTH TODAY AND MAYBE A LITTLE WILD AND
ROMANTIC TOMORROW.  THAT WAS THE SPIRIT BEHIND THE PRESENTS WARD GAVE
RECENTLY TO HIS NEW WIFE, JULIE, A BOOKKEEPER.  He presented her with
an electric can opener because she had been complaining of chipping
her nail polish opening cans, but he also gave her a sapphire ring to
wear on one of her manicured fingers.

3rd paragraph
Some gifts almost universally signal love.  They are made by the
giver- photographs, paintings, knitted sweaters.  Lilly Gross, a
ballet dancer, truly treasures the first gift she received from her
husband Hank.  A dentist, he made her a tiny gold ballet-slipper charm
fashioned from 18-karat dentist's gold.  AS LILLY SAYS, "THE CHARM WAS
EXQUISITE, BUT THE REAL PLEASURE I GOT FROM THE JEWLERY WAS IN KNOWING
HE MADE IT ESPECIALLY FOR ME."

Subheader:
PRACTICAL...OR INSULTING?

5th paragraph
Really practical gifts can be great- or gross.  The worst ones are
things you would probably get anyway and that should be household
expenses.  Say it's your birthday and the toaster is regularly buring
your whole wheat:  If your husband gives you a new toaster it's the
equivalent of killing two birds with one stone- he's knocking off your
birthday plus an item on the family's most-needed list.  Many givers
seem to justify their choices by pointing out that the gift is useful.
BUT IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE SAYING, "OH GOODY, JUST WHAT I ALWAYS WANTED-
A VACUUM CLEANER."

pg. 18		1st column	1st paragraph
OTHER PRACTICAL GIFTS IMPLY SAY "YOU SHOULD KNOW YOUR PLACE."  These
might as well be wrapped in pink for her (frying pans, irons) and blue
for him (lawn mowers, power tools).

2nd paragraph
"A GIFT SHOULD MAKE YOU FEEL SPECIAL," OBSERVES DR. BERGER, "AND SOME
PRACTICAL GIFTS JUST DON'T MAKE YOU FEEL THAT WAY."  REMEMBER, WHAT'S
IMPORTANT IS THE MEANING YOU ATTACH TO THE GIFT.  If your husband
gives you a coffee grinder, it doesn't really matter if it's
practical.  WHAT COUNTS IS IF YOU LOVE THE IDEA OF HAVING FRESHLY
GROUND COFFEE," SAYS BERGER.  (By the same token, Julie loved her
electric can opener because her husband knew it would spare her
beautiful nails.)

3rd paragraph
IN LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIPS THERE IS OFTEN A KIND OF GIFT-GIVING
BURNOUT, AND IT CAN CAUSE COUPLES TO LEAN TOWARD THE PRACTICAL.
THAT'S WHT LED VIVIAN, A DISTRICT ATTORNEY IN NEW YORK CITY, TO BUY
HER HUSBAND, SID, AN AUTOMATIC COFFEE MAKER FOR THEIR 11TH
ANNIVERSARY.  SHE LIKED THE FACT THAT IT COULD TURN ITSELF ON SUNDAY
MORNINGS WHILE THEY WERE IN BED READING THE PAPERS.  Sid opened the
present and laughed- he had bought Vivian the same coffee pot.  THE
MESSAGE WAS CLEAR:  WE TRULY DO KNOW EACH OTHER.  (The only problem
was which pot to return.)

Subheader:
REALLY ROTTEN PRESENTS

4th paragraph
Some gifts are designed not to please the receiver but to control him
or her.  THE MESSAGE CAN BE HIDDEN, SO THE RECIPIENT HAS TO READ
CAREFULLY BETWEEN THE WRAPPINGS AND BOWS.  Albert Angrilli, PhD, a
family therapist in Hartsdale, New York, recalls the homebody husband
who gave hi wife, who loved to travel, an adorable puppy for
Christmas.  The first weekend in January, when the wife suggested they
go away, her husband innocently answered, "Oh, I'd love to, but how
can we leave the puppy?"  IT TOOK AWHILE, BUT SHE FINALLY SAW THROUGH
THE "THOUGHT" BEHIND HER HUSBAND'S SELECTION.

5th paragraph
IF A GOOD GIFT SAYS "THANK YOU FOR BEING YOU," A BAD ONE PRACTICALLY
SINGS OUT "I DON'T LOVE YOU JUST THE WAY YOU ARE."  ACCORDING TO DR.
BERGER, "THESE GIFTS ARE OFTEN PERCEIVED AS SAYING 'WITH MY HELP YOU
CAN IMPROVE.'"

6th paragraph to top of 2nd column
IT WAS OVER 10 YEARS AGO, BUT BERT STILL REMEMBERS THE GIFT
CERTIFICATE HIS WIFE GAVE HIM FOR A HAIRSTYLING AT AN EXPENSIVE SALON.
THE PROBLEM WAS THAT BERT WAS PERFECTLY HAPPY WITH HIS OLD STYLE, AND
HE NEVER USED THE CERTIFICATE.

2nd column	1st paragraph
SUCH GIFTS ARE DESIGNED TO TURN THE RECEIVER INTO WHAT THE GIVER WANTS
HIM TO BE.  Thus, a husband might give his wife cooking lessons
knowing she htes to cook, or a wife might give her overweight mate a
year's membership in a gym.  GIFTS LIKE THESE MAY BE GIVEN TO BE
HELPFUL, BUT THEY ARE OFTEN SEEN AS PUT-DOWNS.  (Remember Jim?  HIS
GIFT OF AN EXERCISE BIKE WAS A MESSAGE TO HIS WIFE TO SHAPE UP AND
THIN DOWN INTO HIS IDEA OF A DREAM MATE.)

2nd paragraph
X-rated lingerie can also be a good example of a bad gift.  "It's
rather typical, though," says Dr. Angrilli.  HE TELLS THE STORY OF A
PROFESSIONAL WOMAN WHO CONSIDERED HERSELF TO BE A HEALTHY, SEXY
FEMALE.  But her husband insisted on buying her see-through nightgowns
and provocative underwear, which she refused to wear.  HIS GIFTS WERE
SUPPOSED TO TRANSFORM HER INTO HIS NOTION OF A SEDUCTIVE WOMAN.  TO
HER, THEY MEANT THAT HER WAY OF BEING SEXY WASN'T ENOUGH.

3rd paragraph
SOME GIFTS ARE SO OBVIOUSLY BAD-INTENTIONED THAT THE MESSAGE IS HARDLY
HIDDEN AT ALL.  AS PSYCHOTHERAPIST LINDA BARBANEL POINTS OUT, "GIFTS
CAN CONVEY:  `I'M MAD AS HELL AT YOU.'  THAT'S TOUGH TO SAY OUT LOUD,
SO THE MESSAGE IS DELIVERED INSTEAD THROUGH A HOSTILE GIFT."

Subheader:
THE PRICE IS RIGHT- THERE

5th paragraph
It's hard to "ooh" or "ah" over a present that's worth five dollars
max.  (The recipient of a plastic hairclip grumbled, "I think he just
picked it up on the steet from a peddler.")  DR. PIAGET NOTES THAT
"SOME GIFTS SAY `I DON'T THINK YOU'RE WORTH A LOT.'  They're so cheap
that they're like leaving a one-cent tip for a waitress."

3rd column	1st paragraph
One of the negative messages of money selecting money is that no
effort went into it.  HOW MUCH THOUGHT DOES IT TAKE TO PICK OUT JUST
THE "RIGHT" BILL?

Subheader:
STRAIGHT TO THE HEART

2nd paragraph
Some of the best gifts of all are those that arise out of genuine
feelings and celebrate no particular occasion- almost like Cupid, the
gift-giver aims  straight for the heart.  They can be small tokens-
like the sea-shells Irv, an interior designer, paints for Fran and
leaves on her desk.  (One shell read:  "I'm gld we have each other.")
SUCH GIFTS OFTEN SPEAK IN THE UNIQUE LANGUAGE OF THE LOVERS AND CAN BE
UNDERSTOOD ONLY BY THEM.  Julie, the bookkeeper, recently packed cans
of Green Giant baby corn in a Tiffany box for Ward, who's a chef.  As
Julie explains the present:  "Ward would never use anything but fresh
vegetables in his restaurant, but at home he enjoys the crunch he gets
from that brand."  Obviously, Ward could buy his own canned corn, but
the beautifully wrapped gift procalimed, "I'm thinking of you and what
you really like."

3rd paragraph
And then there are the couples who don't exchange gifts on traditional
occasions.  Married to Martin for 22 years, Angela has yet to receive
a birthday or anniversary gift from him.  As she explains, "MARTIN HAS
NEVER BELIEVED IN RIGIDLY OBSERVING CERTAIN DAYS.  When I complained,
years and years ago, he said, `It's more important what I do the other
364 days.'"  So Martin celebrates "unbirthdays," "rainy days" and even
"Happy Tuesdays."  Angela may get flowers today or white chocolate
tomorrow.  Recently she found a little box on her home computer.
Inside was a gold heart ring she admired in a neighborhood
jewlery-store window.  THE ATTACHED NOTE READ:  "I KNOW YOUR HEART WAS
SET ON THIS."

DINNER MUSIC

1st column	2nd paragraph
Her findings:  Those who heard the rock `n' roll ate one and a half
times as much as those who listened to slow music or no music.  Why?
Because they at twice as fast (probably lifting their fork in time
with the beat).  A FEELING OF FULLNESS DOESN'T REGISSTER UNTIL 20 TO
25 MINUTES AFTER FOOD IS CONSUMED, SO QUICK DINNERS DON'T REALIZE
THEY'VE HAD ENOUGH UNTIL THEY'VE OVERDONE IT.

WOMEN HAVE LONG KNOWN THAT THEY ARE AT GREATER RISK OF BREAST CANCER

inthe American Journal of Epidemiology suggests that there is special
cause for concern for women under age 55 if the relative developed
cancer before age 40.  Such women were more than twice as likely to
develop breast cancer as those under 55 without a family cancer

Subheader:  HOW TO SAVE MONEY FOR THE KIDS AND REDUCE TAXES AT THE
	SAME TIME
By:  Deborah Rankin

1st column	1st paragraph
WITH ALL THE RUSH AND BUSTLE OF PREPARING FOR THE HOLIDAYS, IT'S EASY
TO FORGET THAT TAX SEASON IS NOT FAR OFF.  A reminder, then:  The
holidays mark the close of one tax year and the beginning of another-
and it is never too late, or too early, to think about minimizing the
annual tax bite on your family's income.

3rd paragraph
AS YOU KNOW, EACH YEAR, YOU AND YOUR HUSBAND MUST PAY TAX (15, 28, OR
33 PERCENT, DEPENDING ON YOUR TAX BRACKET) ON ANY INCOME, SUCH AS
INTEREST, DIVIDENDS, PROFITS FROM SALE, THAT YOUR INVESTMENTS PRODUCE.
YOU MAY NOT KNOW, HOWEVER, THAT YOU CAN REDUCE THE TAX ON THIS INCOME
BY GIVING A PORTION OF THESE ASSETS TO YOUR CHILDREN- WHO, SO LONG AS
CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS ARE OBSERVED, WILL BE TAXED AT A RATE LOWER THAN
YOUR OWN.

5th paragraph
Before choosing to exercise this option, however, you should be aware
that it does entail some risk, because once these gifts are made, they
are irrevocable- meaning that you can't take them back should you find
yourself in a financial pinch.  Furthermore, although your children
can't touch this money while they are minors, once they reach the age
of majority (which should be 18 or 21, as set by your state), all
decisions on how to spend this money are made by them.  "THIS MEANS,"
SAYS KESS, "THAT THEY CAN DO ANYTHING THEY WANT TO WITH THE MONEY.  IF
SANDY BEACHES ARE MORE ENTICING TO THEM THAN IVY COVERED WALLS- THAT'S
THE CHANCE YOU TAKE."

6th paragraph to top of 2nd column
IF YOU'D RATHER NOT TAKE THIS CHANCE, YOU MIGHT CONSIDER TWO OTHER
OPTIONS.  THE FIRST POSSIBILITY IS TO PURCHASE THE NEW "QUALIFIED"
SERIES EE U.S. SAVINGS BONDS.  THESE BONDS CAN BE REDEEMED TOTALLY
TAX-FREE IF THE PROCEEDS ARE USED TO PAY COLLEGE TUITION.  Because the
bonds have to be in your name, not your child's, you can cash them in
at any time and use the money for other purposes if you need to.  (But
in that case you'll have to pay taxes on the interest earned.)  Sounds
perfect right?  But there's a big drawback:  The tax exemption starts
to phase out for the couples with adjusted gross income of $60,000 and
singles with income of $40,000.

SETTING UP A CUSTODIAL ACCOUNT

pg. 32		1st column	5th paragraph to top of 2nd column
You can name yourself as custodian, but it's wiser not to.  THE
REASON:  IF A PARENT SERVES AS BOTH "DONOR" (THE PERSON WHO OPENS AND
MAKES DEPOSITS INTO THE ACCOUNT) AND "CUSTODIAN" (THE PERSON WHO
MANAGES IT), THE ACCOUNT WILL BE CONSIDERED PART OF THAT PARENT'S
ESTATE SHOULD HE OR SHE DIE BEFORE THE CHILD COMES OF AGE.  The result
is that a piece of the estate could be eaten up by federal estate
taxes which might have been avoided had another adult been named
custodian.  If yours is a two-parent household, then, it's best if one
parent acts as "donor" and the other as "custodian."  If you head a
one-parent household, it's wise to name a trusted friend or relative
as custodian.

ONLY YOU AND YOUR HUSBAND CAN DECIDE WHICH OF THESE TAX-SAVING

a few extra hours at tax time filing out seperate returns for your
children.

	OVERTIRED AND OVERWIRED.  THESE TIPS WILL KEEP THEM FROM
	GETTING OUT OF CONTROL
By:  Beth Thames

1st column	1st paragraph
WHEN OUR FIRST CHILD WAS A TODDLER, WE DECIDED TO MAKE OUR CHRISTMAS
TRIP HOME TO VISIT OUR PARENTS IN A NEW WAY:  WE WOULD TRAVEL AT
NIGHT.  THAT WAY, WE REASONED, ELIZABETH WOULD SLEEP, MY HUSBAND AND I
COULD TAKE TURNS SLEEPING AND DRIVING, AND ALL OF US WOULD ARRIVE AT
MY PARENTS' HOME RESETED.  Of course, we were wrong.  Elizabeth sang
"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer" for 600 miles, and raced into her
grandmother's house in a state of frenzy.  As the week wore on, our
daughter became more wired up as a stream of relatives came to the
house for holiday meals and parties.  WE WONDERED HOW SHE COULD STAY
AWAKE SO LONG PAST HER REGULAR BEDTIME, AND FELT EMBARRASSED ABOUT HER
WHINING.  We also wondered if we should skip the Christmas trip next
year.

WHY CHILDREN LOSE CONTROL

4th paragraph
THE FIRST STEP, ACCORDING TO DR. BUSS, IS TO UNDERSTAND WHAT FACTORS
PUSH CHILDREN BEYOND THEIR LIMITS AND TEND TO MAKE THEM OUT OF
CONTROL.

2nd column	1st paragraph
STRESS IS ALL AROUND.  When we try to do too much at Christmas and
become overly tired and anxious, our children pick up on this.  They
often can't differentiate between their stress and ours.

2nd paragraph
FURTHERMORE, WHEN CHILDREN ARE EXCITED, THEY HAVE A LIMITED ABILITY TO
USE LANGUAGE TO REGULATE THEIR FEELINGS, ACCORDING TO PETER A.
WILLIAMSON, PHD, IN HIS NEW BOOK GOOD KIDS, BAD BEHAVIOR (SIMON &
SCHUSTER).  THEIR FEELINGS ARE OFTEN TOO COMPLEX AND OVERWHELMING TO
ARTICULATE.  EVEN OLDER SCHOOL-AGE CHILDREN ARE LIKELY TO VENT THEIR
EMOTIONS THROUGH THEIR BEHAVIOR.

4th paragraph
"ADULTS MAY FEEL OVERWHELMED BY THE DEMANDS OF THE HOLIDAY SEASON, BUT
WE'VE HAD YEARS TO LEARN A PARTICULAR STYLE OF COPING WHEN WE ARE
OVERTIRED OR TOO BUSY," DR. BUDD SAYS.  "OUR CHILDREN DON'T HAVE THE
SAME RANGE OF COPING PATTERNS YET."

5th paragraph to top of pg. 37
EXPECTATIONS MAY BE TOO HIGH.  IN ADDITION TO THE HOLIDAY STRESS, WE
ADD AN EXTRA BURDEN IN THAT WE EXPECT CHILDREN TO BE ON THEIR BEST
BEHAVIOR THE WHOLE TIME, OR IN WHAT DR. BUDD CALLS "THE PERFORMANCE
MODE."  WE EXPECT THEM TO SHARE EXCITING NEW TOYS WITH COUSINS THEY
MAY SEE ONLY ONCE A YEAR; WE WANT THEM TO SHOW GRANDMA AND GRANDPA WHAT
GOOD ANNERS THEY HAVE; WE CALL UPON THEM TO BE FRIENDLY AND GRACIOUS
TO UNCLE CHARLIE WITH HIS SCARY BOOMING VOICE OR GREAT-AUNT SELMA WITH
HER FUNNY-SMELLING PERFUME.  It's a lot to ask.

pg. 37		1st column	2nd paragraph
WE WANT TO HAVE A JOYFUL HOLIDAY SEASON WITH OUR FAMILIES AND FRIENDS.
Wo how do we go about it?  PARENTS NEED TO BUILD AN EARLY WARNING
SYSTEM THAT TELLS THEM WHEN THEIR CHILDREN ARE EXCITED BUT STILL
CAPABLE OF THINKING, CONFORTING THEMSELVES AND FOLLOWING DIRECTIONS,"
EXPLAINS DR. WILLIAMSON.  Child and family experts offer the following
advice to help overstimulated children calm down.

5th paragraph
Parents can't rehearse every possible coming event, but it helps to
anticipate any big problems that may result from a change in routine.
"IF YOU TAKE A CHILD SHOPPING WITH YOU AFTER WORK, YOU CAN EXPECT HER
TO BE HUNGRY, TIRED OR CRANKY, SAYS SUSAN SEIDMAN, PHD, CHIEF OF
CHILDREN'S SERVICES AT ROCKLAND CHILDREN'S PSYCHIATRIC CENTER IN
ORANNGEBURG, NEW YORK.  Before she begins to whine for a candy bar,
give her animal crackers or a pretzel.  Keep her focused by asking her
to name all of the red things she sees in the store.  If she's
pointing at red sweaters and Santas, she'll be less likely to throw a
tantrum.  Take along some distraction, like a picture book or toy.

SET LIMITS FOR YOUR RELATIVES

"WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT FAMILIES GO THROUGH STAGES ALONG WITH THEIR
CHILDREN- THIS YEAR WE MANAGE THIS WAY BECAUSE THE CHILDREN ARE SMALL,
AND IN A FEW YEARS, WE'LL MANAGE ANOTHER WAY," DR. BUDD SAYS.  "BUT IF
WE IGNORE OUR CHILD'S NEEDS, WE CAN LOSE SIGHT OF WHAT THE HOLIDAYS
SHOULD BE ABOUT- GIVING, UNDERSTANDING AND HARMONY."  As long as you
explain to the relatives in advance why you need to vary plans or that
you and your youngster may slip away from the dinner table, no one is
likely to take offense.  In fact, they'll probably be relieved.
"Nothing disturbs harmony like a three-year-old who has missed her
nap," points out Dr. Budd.

3rd column	1st paragraph
It's also important for parents to explain to other adults how they
can help keep a child from becoming overwrought.  YOU CAN'T EXPECT
YOUR CHILD TO DO ALL THE ADAPTING; IF RELATIVES ARE ROUGHHOUSING TOO
MUCH, OR INSISTING ON HUGS AND KISSES PREMATURELY, YOU HAVE TO STAND
UP FOR YOUR CHILD'S NEEDS AND REMIND THE GROWNUPS THAT THEY MUST TAKE
THINGS MORE SLOWLY.

BE CLEAR ABOUT THE RULES

LET HIM KNOW WHEN HE'S DOING A GOOD JOB, TOO.  If you find him playing
quietly, say to him:  "Look how well you've settled yourself down.
You're playing with those Legos so nicely.  I'm proud of you."
Positive reinforcement when he's doing well is just as important as an
early warning when he breaks the rules.

TAKE A BREAK FROM THE CROWD

2nd column	1st paragraph
TAKING A BREAK ALSO FULFILLS ANOTHER IMPORTANT FUNCTION- IT ALLOWS YOU
TO FOCUS ALL YOUR ATTENTION ON YOUR CHILD, WHO IS LIKELY TO BE FEELING
LEFT OUTOF THE GROWNUPS ACTIVITIES.  It's easy for parents to get so
involved with food preparations and catching with family and friends
that they forget about the kids and hope the can fend for themselves.
BUT IF EACH SET OF PARENTS TAKES JUST A LITTLE TIME GO GO OFF
PRIVATELY WITH THEIR OWN CHILD- TO CHECK IN, ASK IF EVERYTHINGS'S
GOING ALL RIGHT AND FIND OUT IF SHE'S HAVING FUN WITH THE OTHER KIDS-
THOSE FEW MINUTES CAN GO A LONG WAY TOWARD KEEPING EXCITEMENT IN CHECK
AND TURNING AROUND DISAPPOINTMENTS AND TENSIONS BEFORE THEY REACH THE
EXPLOSIVE STAGE.

Thompson advises parents against letting children "run it all off

GET RID OF TENSION, BUT CHILDREN OFTEN BECOME MORE ENERGETIC, AND FIND
IT EVEN HARDER TO WIND DOWN.

IF YOU NOTICE AS THE EVENING WEARS ON THAT YOUR CHILD IS LOSING
CONTROL AND BECOMING INCREASINGLY ACTIVE, THOMPSON SUGGESTS SOME
RELAXING GAMES RIGHT BEFORE BEDTIME.

WHEN YOUR BEST EFFORTS FAIL

5th paragraph
Most experts agree that it's easier to deal with active children on
their own turf, where we can anticipate problems.  Traveling presents
constant challenges, because so much is out of our control.  Sometimes
we simply have to do the best we can.  AND SOMETIMES, AS I FOUND ON A
HOLIDAY TRIP TO WASHINGTON SEVERAL YEARS AGO, OUR BEST IS NOT GOOD
ENOUGH.

2nd column	1st paragraph
AT A CHINESE RESTAURANT THAT NIGHT, WHERE WE WENT TO TAKE A BREAK FROM
THE LARGE GATHERING OF RELATIVES, WE NOTICED THAT BRYAN, OUR
TWO-YEAR-OLD, HAD DEVELOPED A NASTY COUGH AND AN EVEN NASTIER HABIT OF
SAYING, "SHUT UP YOUR FACE!" WHENEVER WE ASKED HIM ANYTHING.

Title:  What Money Can't Buy
Subheader:  THE FOUR WISEST GIFTS YOU CAN GIVE YOUR CHILD
By:  Michael Schulman

1st column	1st paragraph
This is the time of year, of course, when we all have presents on our
minds.  We look forward to watching our children's joyful faced- eyes
wide ad bright- as they tear through the paper and ribbon we so
carefully wrapped around our selections.  AS I PROWLED THE TOY STORE
IN SEARCH OF SOMETHING SPECTACULAR TO GIVE MY DAUGHTER, THOUGHTS OF MY
FRIEND JOE CAME TO MIND.

2nd paragraph
Joe is a man of character- the kind of friend you can count on.  I've
seen him through many ups and downs during the years of our
friendship- some of the downs quite serious, involving the death of
loved ones and weighty financial problems.  YET SOMEHOW HE ALWAYS
RETAINED HIS GENEROUS, OPTIMISTIC SPIRIT; LIFE'S STORMS COULD NOT
UNDERMINE IS CORE OF FAITH IN HIMSELF, AT LEAST NOT FOR LONG.

3rd paragraph
As a psychologist, I'm naturally curious about how people develop
their unique personalities.  MANY TIMES OVER THE YEARS I'VE WONDERED
HOW JOE ACQUIRED SO SOLID A SENSE OF WHO HE WAS AND WHAT HE STOOD FOR.
Psychological research hasn't yet sorted out just how inborn
characteristics, family and other environmental circumstances interact
to determine the men and women we become.  Yet Joe once revealed
something about his childhood that I suspect contributed profoundly to
the man he became.

2nd column	1st paragraph
I asked him about his relationship with his father, who had died some
years before I met Joe.  He told me that his father owned a candy
store and worked long hours, often seven days a week.  "He didn't have
much time for us to do things together," Joe explained.  "BUT I
REMEMBER WHEN I WAS A LITTLE KID- AND EVEN LATER WHEN I WAS LIVING ON
MY OWN- THAT WHENEVER I WALKED INTO HIS STORE, MY DAD GOT A LOOK ON
HIS FACE AS IF THE GREATEST PERSON IN THE WORLD HAD JUST ARRIVED.  His
eyes lit up, and I guess mine did too.  I look back at those
afternoons- with him teaching me how to scoop ice cream and make
sodas- as the best of times."

2nd paragraph
THE LIGHT IN HIS FATHER'S EYES CREATED A GLOW INSIDE JOE THAT
CONTINUES TO WARM HIM THESE MANY YEARS LATER.  JOE RECEIVED THE GIFT
OF LOVE FROM HIS FATHER, AN INTANGIBLE TREASURE THAT I'M SURE HELPED
FORM THE STRONG, SOLID CORE OF HIS PERSONALITY.

3rd paragraph to top of 3rd column
Obviously, nothing I could find for my daughter in the toy store could
match that.  Now don't think I'm putting down toys.  KIDS LOVE THEM
AND GROW FROM THEM, YET THIS MIGHT BE A GOOD TIME OF YEAR TO STOP FOR
A MOMENT TO THINK ABOUT WHAT WE REALLY WANT TO GIVE OUR CHILDREN, WHAT
GIFTS WILL TRULY ENRICH AND SUSTAIN THEM THROUGHOUT THEIR LIVES.  Here
are some suggestions for a different, and more meaningful, kind of
gift list:

Subheader:
THE GIFT OF AWE

3rd column	1st paragraph
THE FRENCH WRITER COLETTE DESCRIBES HOW SHE RECEIVED THE GIFT OF AWE
FROM HER MOTHER, SIDO, IN THE BOOK EARTHLY PARADISE (FARRAR, STRAUS
AND GIROUX):

3rd paragraph to top of pg. 43
Sido's word was "Look," but in that word was a celebration of the
beauty awaiting all of her child's senses at every turn.  THROUGH THE
GIFT OF AWE OUR CHILDREN GO OUT INTO THE WORLD IN EXCITED ANTICIPATION
OF WHAT THEY MIGHT FIND THERE.  AWE OVER NATURAL BEAUTY GIVES THEM A
KIND OF HARBOR TO RETURN TO WHEN LIFE'S OBSTACLES SEEM OVERWHELMING.
Our children will pretty much face the struggles we have, needing to
find their way through relationships, moral delimmas, financial
uncertainties and countless other challenges.  IF THEY CAN STILL
NOTICE AND BE AWED BY THE BEAUTY ALL AROUND THEM- IN THE DANCE OF A
ROBIN ON THE LAWN OR THE CARVINGS OVER THE DOORWAY ACROSS THE STREET-
THEIR WORLD WILL NEVER TURN INTO A MORE "SEA OF TROUBLES."  So, like
Sido, celebrate the world for your child!

Subheader:
THE GIFT OF IDEALS

pg. 43		1st column	1st paragraph
This is a cynical age, with few heroes and increasing uncertainty over
values.  Yet this Christmas season, millions of us will sit in front
of our TV sets and watch (again) the movie IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE.
WE'LL SEE GEORGE BAILEY DISCOVERING THAT HE HAS BEEN LIVING A LIFE
CONSISTENT WITH HIS HIGHEST IDEALS.  GEORGE HAD NEVER IDENTIFIED THEM
FOR HIMSELF UNTIL AN ANGEL NAMED CLARENCE HELPED HIM SEE THAT HIS HARD
DECISIONS AT CRITICAL POINTS IN HIS LIFE HAD ALL BEEN GUIDED BY HIS
COMMITMENT TO TREAT OTHERS KINDLY AND FAIRLY.

2nd paragraph
America's infatuation with George Bailey is curious- and heartening.
MANY PARENTS I KNOW HAVE INTRODUCED THEIR CHILDREN TO IT'S A WONDERFUL
LIFE HOPING THE FILM WOULD COMMUNICATE THE MESSAGE OF VALUES AND HOPE
THAT THE PARENTS THEMSELVES HAD BEEN UNABLE TO EXPRESS.  MANY WILL
WATCH THE FILM WITH THEIR CHILDREN WHILE GRUMBLING THAT EVERYONE IS
BASICALLY SELFISH- NOT REALIZING THAT THEIR NEIGHBORS ACROSS THE HALL
AND ACROSS THE NATION ARE WATCHING THE SAME FILM WITH THEIR CHILDREN
FOR THE VERY SAME PURPOSE:  TO HELP THEM DEVELOP WORTHY IDEALS.

3rd paragraph
OUR IDEALS DEFINE FOR US WHAT WE BELIEVE CONSTITUTES A WONDERFUL LIFE,
AND THAT SIMPLE MOVIE'S THUNDEROUS MESSAGE IS THAT THE MEASURE OF A
WONDERFUL LIFE IS THE GOOD IT BRINGS ABOUT.  THE IDEALS PROPOUNDED IN
THE FILM ARE THE ENEMY OF SELFISHNESS AND AN ANTIDOTE TO CYNICISM.
And if video sales are any gauge, many of us still believe in those
ideals.

4th paragraph
YET WHEN I ASK PARENTS, "WHAT DO YOUR CHILDREN THINK YOU STAND FOR?",
MANY REALIZE THAT THEY HAVEN'T DELIVERED A CLEAR MESSAGE TO THEIR
CHILDREN ABOUT VALUES.  SOMETIMES IT'S BECAUSE ADULTS AREN'T STRAIGHT
IN THEIR OWN MINDS ABOUT WHAT THEY DO BELIEVE; SOMETIMES IT'S BECAUSE
THEY'RE SO HARRIED BY THE DEMANDS OF LIFE THAT, LIKE GEORGE BAILEY,
THEY HAVEN'T TAKEN TIME TO ARTICULATE THE FRAMEWORK OF VALUES THAT
GUIDES THEIR CHOICES.  AND SOMETIMES THEY'RE SIMPLY AFRAID THEY'LL
SOUND SAPPY OR OLD-FASHIONED.

2nd column	1st paragraph
That's unfortunate.  OUR CHILDREN NEED TO BELIEVE IN THE POSSIBILITY
OF LIVING A WONDERFUL LIFE, THAT THERE ARE GOALS (BEYOND MORE NINTENDO
TAPES) THAT ARE WORTH STRIVING FOR, AND THAT THEIR DAILY UPS AND DOWNS
ADD UP TO SOMETHING MEANINGFUL.  In other words, children need ideals.
When parents share the principles they live by, they give their
children a head start on the road to defining their own ideals.  Then
parents and children can work for a wonderful life together.

Subheader:
THE GIFT OF CONFIDENCE

2nd paragraph
WHEN WE CALL SOMEONE CONFIDENT WE MEAN A NUMBER OF THINGS:  THAT HE
HAS FAITH HE CAN ACHIEVE WHAT HE SETS OUT TO ACHIEVE, THAT HE WILL
WORK HARD AND PERSEVERE DESPITE SETBACKS OR CRITICISM AND THAT HE SETS
LOFTY GOALS FOR HIMSELF.  These assets are wonderful to see in a
child.  WHEN FIXED ON A GOAL OR FACED WITH FRUSTRATION, THE INNDER
VOICE OF THE CONFIDENT CHILD SAYS, "I CAN DO IT."  Without this voice
children give up easily and set their sights low.  Louis Pasteur
captured the essence of confidence when he said, "Let me tell you the
secret that has led me to my goal.  My strenth lies in my tenacity."

3rd paragraph
Want to see confidence and tenacity?  Watch a nine-month-old trying to
climb a stircase, unrelenting in her pursuit despite setbacks.  Want
another example?  Observe a three-year-old insisting on zipping her
own jacket, exclaiming, "I want to do it myself."  Children start out
confident.  They come into the world programmed to master it.  IF THE
CHILD ON THE STAIR CASE COULD TELL YOU WHY SHE WANTS TO CLIMB IT, I'M
SURE SHE WOULD ECHO SIR EDMUND HILLARY'S REASON FOR CLIMBING MOUNT
EVEREST:  BECAUSE IT IS THERE.

4th paragraph
CHILDREN WANT TO KNOW AND DO EVERYTHING- TO GET INTO EVERY CABINET,
CLIMB EVERY STAIRCASE, TAKE EVERY OBJECT APART AND PUT IT BACK
TOGETHER.  They may differ in their interests and exuberance, but they
don't ordinarily start out with problems in motivation or confidence.

5th paragraph
SOMETIMES, THOUGH, FRUSTRATIONS BECOME EXCESSIVE, AND PARENTS,
TEACHERS, SIBLINGS OR PLAYMATES FOCUS ON WHAT THE CHILD CAN'T DO,
SHOULDN'T DO AND SHOULDN'T EVEN THINK OF TRYING.  Sometimes children
get the message that it's not OK to fail, or that their own goals
aren't acceptable ("My son is going to be an athlete, not a dancer").
Moreover, pursuing goals often involveds time and a fair amount of
mess.  And sometimes children get the message that it is more
important to stay quiet, controlled and neat.

3rd column	1st paragraph
PARENTS CAN FOSTER CONFIDENCE IN MANY WAYS:  BY COMMUNICATING THEIR
JOY IN THEIR CHILD'S STRIVINGS, REGARDLESS OF ULTIMATE SUCCESS OR
FAILURE; BY ASSISTING IN THOSE STRIVINGS WHEN NECESSARY, BUT ONLY
ENOUGH SO THEIR CHILD CAN STILL FEEL A SENSE OF ACCOMPLISHMENT; BY
TAKING THEIR CHILD'S PROJECTS SERIOUSLY, WHETHER SHE IS LINING UP HER
STUFFED ANIMALS IN A PERFECT ROW OR BUILDING A CASTLE OUT OF POPSICLE
STICKS; BY REMINDING THEIR YOUNGSTER THAT SETBACKS ARE A NATURAL PART
OF ANY WORTHWHILE PURSUIT; AND BY RETELLING STORIES ABOUT PERSISTENCE,
FROM THE LITTLE ENGINE THAT COULD TO ACCOUNTS OF REAL-LIFE PEOPLE WHO
CLUNG FAST TO THEIR VISION DESPITE DISAPPOINMENTS OR DERISION.

Subheader:
THE GIFT OF LOVE

3rd paragraph
A BIT MORE ON MY FRIEND JOE:  AS I INDICATED, JOE'S FATHER ENJOYED HIS
SON AND LET HIM KNOW IT.  BUT DON'T THINK THEY DIDN'T HAVE CONFLICTS
LIKE ANY OTHER PARENT AND CHILD.  JOE DESCRIBED HIS FATHER AS "A TOUGH
OLD GUY WHO LET ME KNOW WHEN I WAS OFF THE MARK."  IF HE THOUGHT JOE
WAS DOING SOMETHING THAT HURT OTHERS OR HIMSELF, JOE'S FATHER WOULD
INTERVENE.  BUT EVEN THEN, JOE NEVER DOUBTED THAT HIS FATHER WAS
FUNDAMENTALLY ON HIS SIDE.  That's the essence of the gift of love.
IF OUR CHILDREN COME TO FEEL THAT WE ROOT FOR THEM EVEN WHEN WE FIND
IT NECESSARY TO SAY NO, WE CAN REST SECURE THAT WE'VE GIVEN THEM A
GIFT WHICH WILL LAST A LIFETIME.

Title:  The Reproductive Rights Battle
Subheader:  ARE COMPANY POLICIES THAT CLAIM TO BE PROTECTING UNBORN
	CHILDREN REALLY JUST DISCRIMINATION IN DISGUISE?
By:  Sandra Blakeslee

1st column	1st paragraph
GINNY GREEN WAS 50 YEARS OLD WHEN SHE LEARNED SHE WOULD HAVE TO GIVE
UP HER HIGH-PAYING JOB WITHOVERTIME IN A BATTERY FACTORY IN
BENNINGTON, VERMONT.  The reason?  She might accidently get pregnant
and her fetus might be poisoned by the lead she works with on the job.
HER COMPANY, JOHNSON CONTROLS, SAID- AS A MATTER OF POLICY- THAT IT
COULD NOT TRUST HER, OR ANY WOMAN, TO CONTROL HER FERTILITY.

2nd paragraph
"I WAS OUTRAGED," GREEN SAYS.  "I WORKED HARD FOR MY SENIORITY AND THE
THOUGHT OF PREGNANCY AT MY AGE WAS RIDICULOUS."  Green's union job,
stacking metal plates covered with lead paste, paid $10 an hour plus
health benefits.  An energetic worker, she needed the work and its
overtime pay to help her family make ends meet.  In Bennington, few
positions pay as well.  Her only alternative was to seek minimum-wage
work, which would impoverish her family.

4th paragraph
NOW THE SUPREME COURT IS TO DECIDE IF GINNY GREEN'S EMPLOYER HAD THE
RIGHT TO FORCE HER OFF THE FACTORY FLOOR BECAUSE SHE WAS FERTILE AND
MIGHT ENDANGER A FETUS.  The lawsuit, United Automobile Workers (UAW)
versus Johnson Controls, has been called the most important sex
discrimination case in any court in 25 years.

Subheader:
AT THE ROOT OF THE PROBLEM

2nd column	1st paragraph
Fetal-protection policies are blanket measures barring women from jobs
that might imperil a fetus.  NO ONE KNOWS HOW MANY COMPANIES HAVE SUCH
POLICIES, SAYS BERTIN, BUT THEY ARE COMMON IN HEAVY INDUSTRIES THAT
TRADITIONALLY EMPLOY MEN IN HANDSOMELY COMPENSATED UNION JOBS.
According to one recent study,  20 percent of manufacturing companies
in Massachusetts have policies that exclude women from coming into
contact with toxic substances.

3rd paragraph
UNDOUBTEDLY, WOMEN WOULD RATHER AVOID EXPOSURE TO HARMFUL SUBSTANCES.
AND WHAT MOTHER-TO-BE DOESN'T WANT TO PROTECT HER UNBORN CHILD?  BUT
WOMEN DON'T WANT TO BE DISCRIMINATED AGAINST EITHER:  THE FACT IS, MEN
ARE ALSO VULNERABLE TO ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTANTS, AND TOXIC MATERIALS
CAN DAMAGE SPERM.  So why is it that only the women have been singled
out for "protection"?  Wouldn't it be better to make the workplace
safe for all workers?

Subheader:
THE JOHNSON CONTROLS STORY

pg. 46		1st column	1st paragraph
But women and fetuses are not the only ones at risk.  Lead in high
doses produces abnormal sperm and causes male infertility, says lead
expert Herbert Needleman, MD, a pediatrician and psychiatrist at the
University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine.  At lower doses, not
unlike those found in factories, it has been linked with heart
disease, irritability, memory loss, stroke and reduced libido.  UNTIL
STUDIES ARE DONE ON HOW THESE LOWER LEAD LEVELS AFFECT THE MALE
REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM, SAYS NEEDLEMAN, "WE CANNOT CONCLUDE THAT LOW
LEVELS ARE SAFE FOR MEN AND THEIR FUTURE OFFSPRING."

3rd paragraph
In 1978, the first federal standard for lead in the workplace was set.
BUT AT THE SAME TIME, SAYS ZUTZ, COMPANY PHYSICIANS FELT THAT THE
ADULT STANDARD WAS NOT A SAFE LEVEL FOR DEVELOPING FETUSES.  Women
were asked to voluntarily refrain from getting pregnant if they worked
in high-lead areas, or to request transfer to low-lead areas, where,
unfortunately, the pay was even lower.

4th paragraph
Between 1978 and 1983, six women got pregnant while working in
high-lead areas.  ALTHOUGH NONE OF THE SUBSEQUENTLY BORN CHILDREN
SHOWED SIGNS OF BEING HARMED, JOHNSON CONTROLS FELT THAT THE VOLUNTARY
POLICY WAS NOT WORKING.  Since half of all pregnancies are unplanned,
women could not guarentee that they would not get pregnant.
Consequently, the company adopted its first mandatory fetal-protection
policy:  All women of childbearing age who didn't present a doctor's
not proving sterilization were banned from the factory floor- not to
protect them but to protect their potential fetuses.

5th paragraph
At the Johnson Controls battery plant in Louisville, Kentucky, "the
majority of women had their tubes cut and tied," says Patricia Lynn
Briner, 39, who decided not to opt for sterilization and was
transferred to the shipping department.  "I DON'T INTEND TO HAVE MORE
BABIES," SAYS THIS MOTHER OF TWO GROWN CHILDREN, "BUT I ALSO DON'T
WANT TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL FOR UNNECESSARY SURGERY JUST TO PROVE A POINT."

2nd column	2nd paragraph
A year ago, the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit
in Chicago upheld the company's policy.  In explaining the decision,
Judge John Coffey said:  "The status of women inAmerica has changed
both in the family and in the economic system.  SINCE THEY HAVE BECOME
A FORCE IN THE WORKPLACE AS WELL AS IN THE HOME BECAUSE OF THEIR
DESIRE TO BETTER THE FAMILY'S STATION IN LIFE, IT WOULD BE IMPROBABLE
THAT A FEMALE EMPLOYEE MIGHT SOMEHOW RATIONALLY DISCOUNT THIS CLEAR
RISK IN HER HOPE AND BELIEF THAT HER INFANT WOULD NOT BE ADVERSELY
AFFECTED FROM LEAD EXPOSURE.  The unborn child has no opportunity to
avoid this grave danger, but bears the definite risk of suffering
permanent consequences."

Subheader:
LEGACY OF DISCRIMINATION

7th paragraph
TO PROTECT WOMEN FROM THESE UGLY CONDITIONS, MANY STATES PASSED LABOR
LAWS THAT GAVE WOMEN "SAFE HARBOR" IN A RANGE OF POORLY PAID
OCCUPATIONS TO WHICH THEY WERE THOUGHT TO BE "SUITED" SEWING, TYPING,
TEACHING AND SO ON.  They were not allowed to work long hours or at
night, unless their services were indispensable.  (Nurses, for
example, were exempted from the labor laws.)  Society unwittingly
condoned discrimination against women by deining them as the weaker
sex, says Bertin.

pg. 47		1st column	1st paragraph
AS IN THE PAST, WHAT WOMEN ARE REALLY BEING "PROTECTED" FROM ARE JOBS
THAT MEN DESIRE, SAYS WOMEN'S RIGHTS ADVOCATES.  Fetal-protection
policies are simply not applied to low-paying jobs like operating view
display erminals and working on assembly lines in the electronics
industry.  THERE ARE RISKS INVOLVED IN THOSE WORKPLACES, TOO, SAYS
EXPERTS, YET NO ONE SEEMS INTERESTED IN PROTECTING WOMEN AND FETUSES
IN SUCH SETTINGS.  Nurses are routinely exposed to hazardous chemicals
like aerosol medications and the gases used in operating rooms, but
these women are rarely excluded from the workplace during pregnancy
for the simple reason that there is a shortage of nurses right now.
Undoubtedly, there's a double standard at work here.

Subheader:
IS THERE A BETTER SOLUTION?

2nd paragraph
If industries really wanted to take a practical approach to the
problem, they would clean up the workplace instead of trying to ban
women, says Marc Lappe, a bioethicist at the University of Illinois
Medical School in Chicago and expert in the workplace hazards.  THE
FETAL-PROTECTION DEBATE HINGES ON THE NOTION THAT WOMEN, THEREFORE
FETUSES, ARE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO TOXINS THAN MEN, HE SAYS.  But in
some cases men are more vulnerable to on-the-job hazards.  For
instance, they are six or seven times more susceptible than women to
liver cancer from exposure to vinyl chloride, says Lappe.  (Indeed,
when industry learned this fact, it didn't ban men from the factory
floor, but tightened standards for vinyl chloride to make the
workplace safe.)

3rd paragraph
ALTHOUGH SCIENTISTS HAVE NOT DONE MANY STUDIES ON MALE REPRODUCTIVE
HAZARDS, THEY SUSPECT THAT SPERM ARE PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE TO
ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINANTS.  The male testes produce a new batch of
sperm approximately every 60 days.  If a man is exposed to toxins or
radiation, his sperm may be affected for many weeks.  Women's eggs, on
the other hand, are already formed at birth and so many be less
vulnerable to workplace toxins, says Lappe.

6th paragraph
STILL, THE CRUCIAL POINT OFTEN OVERLOOKED, HE SAYS, IS THAT IN OTHER
CIRCUMSTANCES THE FETUS IS THE LEAST SUSCEPTIBLE.  An estimated 12 to
13 chemicals are more carcinogenic to adults than to fetuses.  Because
the fetal liver is not well developed, toxic substances that would be
processed by that organ are shunted through the fetus's body without
doing harm.  Vinyl chloride is less toxic to a fetus than to either a
man or a woman.

2nd column	1st paragraph
BUT THOUGH THE LOGICAL SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEMS OR REPRODUCTIVE
HAZARDS IS FOR EMPLOYERS TO CLEAN UP THE WORKPLACE TO PROTECT
EVERYONE- WOMEN, MEN AND FETUSES ALIKE, MANY COMPANIES ARE AGAINST THE
IDEA.  They argue that the cost would force them out of business, and
some industries would probably leave the United States rather than
change, says critics.  Battery factories are already moving offshore
to Asia, Central America and the Caribbean because the expense of
cleaning up their workplaces is considered too high.

2nd paragraph
FOR COMPANIES THAT STAY PUT AND ENACT FETAL-PROTECTION POLICIES,
PERHAPS, A MORE HONEST MOTIVE THAT CONCERN OVER THE WELFARE OF WOMEN
AND FETUSES IS FEAR OF LAWSUITS, SAYS BERTIN.  THERE IS THE REALISTIC
WORRY THAT A WOMAN WHO ACCEPTS THE RISK OF WORKING AROUND REPRODUCTIVE
HAZARDS AND THEN GIVES BIRTH TO A CHILD WITH DEFECTS WILL SUE THE
COMPANY.

3rd paragraph
BUT GINNY GREEN AND OTHER WOMEN AFFECTED BY FETAL-PROTECTION POLICIES
SAY THERE IS A WAY AROUND THIS THREAT:  A WOMAN WHO WANTS TO WORK IN
AN ENVIRONMENT THAT IS POTENTIALLY HAZARDOUS TO A FETUS COULD SIGN AN
AFFIDAVIT STATING THAT SHE IS AWARE OF THE KNOWN RISKS AND WILL NOT
HOLD THE COMPANY ACCOUNTABLE SHOULD SHE BECOME PREGNANT AND HAVE
PROBLEMS ARISING FROM THE EXPOSURE.

4th paragraph
GREEN, WHO WOULD HAVE WILLINGLY SIGNED SUCH AN AFFIDAVIT, IS STILL
WASHING THE REPIRATORS AND DIRTY GLOVES OF THE MEN WHO REPLACED HER ON
THE PRODUCTION LINE.  IRONICALLY, HER BLOOD LEAD LEVEL FREQUENTLY
RISES WHEN SHE IS EXPOSED TO THE LEAD ON THE MEN'S GLOVES.  "IF THE
COMPANY WERE REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT MY HEALTH," SHE SAYS, "THEY WOULD
BE WORRIED ABOUT THIS, BUT THEY'RE NOT."

6th paragraph
FOR THE TIME BEING, GREEN- WHO SAYS SHE WORRIES ABOUT HER DAUGHTER'S
FUTURE IN A MALE-DOMINATED WORK WORLD- PATIENTLY AWAITS THE SUPREME
COURT'S DECISION.

7th paragraph
She has reason to be optimistic:  In a similar case- Grant versus
General Motors Corp., involving GM and Pat Grant, an iron pourer in
the company's Central Foundry facility in Defiance, Ohio- a federal
appeals court set aside a previous judgment in favor of the company.
THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT SAID THAT IT AGREED
"WITH THE VIEW OF THE DISSENTERS IN JOHNSON CONTROLS THAT
FETAL-PROTECTION POLICIES PERFORCE AMOUNT TO OVERT SEX
DISCRIMINATION..."  AS A RESULT, THE COURT REMANDED THE CASE; IT IS
NOW UP TO GM TO PROVE THAT ITS POLICY IS WITHOUT A DOUBT ESSENTIAL TO
A SAFE AND EFFICIENT WORKPLACE.
