Title:  "That Drives Me Crazy!"
Subheader:  LITTLE ANNOYANCES CAN RUIN A GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH YOUR
	CHILD'S CAREGIVER
By:  Nancy Balaban

1st column	1st paragraph
Every child care arrangement, whether in one's home, in family day
care or at a center, has the potential for many misunderstandings and
disagreements.  IDEAS ABOUT CHILD-REARING PROVOKE PASSIONATE OPINIONS
IN EVEN THE MILDEST PARENT.  No wonder mothers often drive caregivers
crazy- and vice versa!  Here are some common complaints and possible
remedies from both camps, starting with the caregiver's side of the
story.

3rd paragraph to top of 2nd column
As an early-childhood educator, I've spoken with many providers who
have been inconvenienced by parents' lateness.  ONE CAREGIVER ECHOED
WHAT OTHERS FEEL- "I'M A WORKING MOTHER TOO, AND I HAVE TO GET HOME TO
MY FAMILY!  PARENTS FORGET HOW HARD IT IS- PHYSICALLY AND EMOTIONALLY-
TO TAKE CARE OF YOUNG CHILDREN ALL DAY LONG.  I get worn out from my
job just as much as they do from theirs."

2nd column	1st paragraph
>From the tone of this teacher's voice it's obvious that she feels more
than anger when parents come late.  SHE FEELS INSULTED- AND RESENTFUL:
"TARDINESS DEMEANS THE PARTNERSHIP WE'RE TRYING TO FORM WITH PARENTS.
And it's unfair; we don't get paid for overtime!"

2nd paragraph
WHAT TO DO?  THE BOTTOM LINE IS TO RECOGNIZE THAT YOUR LATENESS CAUSES
STRESS FOR A CAREGIVER.  Come right out and genuinely apologize for
it.  SAYING YOU'RE SORRY MAY NOT MAKE THINGS ALL BETTER, BUT AT LEAST
YOUR CAREGIVER WILL KNOW THAT YOU UNDERSTAND HER SITUATION.  Offer to
pay an additional fee if you do not do so as part of your regular
arrangement.

3rd paragraph
Of course there'll be some situations you simply can't control, like
last-minute overtime work or transportation snafus.  So don't wait for
an emergency- set up a contingency plan for someone else to pick up
your child when this happens.  (BEFORE THE OCCASION ARISES, MAKE SURE
THE CAREGIVER IS CLEAR ABOUT WHO HAS YOUR PERMISSION TO PICK UP YOUR
CHILD.)  While there is no perfect solution for avoiding occasional
lateness, an upfront discussion will ease the tension down the road.

3rd column	1st paragraph
BEEF #2:  "MOTHERS DON'T TREAT US WITH RESPECT!"  MANY CAREGIVERS FEEL
THAT THEIR PROFESSIONALISM IS NOT APPRECIATED.  After all, most of
these women have had years of valuable experience with children.  ONE
TEACHER TOLD ME THAT THE WAY SOME MOTHERS TREAT HER MAKES HER FEEL
LIKE A SERVANT.  "They get angry if I can't locate a lost mitten or a
misplaced sweater!  It's hard to work positively with parents like
that," she said.

2nd paragraph
A family day care provider described a mother's unreasonable demand:
"She insisted that I keep her daugher indoors when the child wasn't
sick."  THIS WOMAN DIDN'T TRUST THE CAREGIVER TO JUDGE FOR HERSELF
WHEN IT WAS OK TO LET THE CHILD PLAY OUTDOORS.

3rd paragraph
Another mother asked her family day care provider to take her son to
the potty every half hour.  ACCORDING TO THE PROVIDER, THAT WAS
IMPOSSIBLE TO DO, AND IN HER OPINION, THE CHILD WASN'T READY TO BE
TRAINED YET ANYWAY.

4th paragraph
Demands like those produce indignation.  CAREGIVERS FEEL THEY DESERVE
MORE CREDIT FOR THEIR COMMON SENSE AND EXPERIENCE.

5th paragraph to top of pg. 78
WHAT TO DO?  REMEMBER THAT YOUR PROVIDER PROBABLY HAS MANY GOOD IDEAS
ABOUT HOW TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS THAT FACE YOU AND YOUR CHILD.  ASK FOR
HER ADVICE WHEN DIFFICULTIES ARISE, AND FIGURE OUT HOW TO MODIFY YOUR
REQUESTS SO THAT YOU AND SHE CAN WORK TOGETHER.  In the long run this
will benefit your child.  Kids feel better when they believe that
their parents and caregivers like and respect one another.

pg. 78		1st column	1st paragraph
BEEF #3:  "MOTHERS FORGET TO GIVE US IMPORTANT INFORMATION."  ANOTHER
MAJOR COMPLAINT IS THAT PARENTS DON'T TELL CAREGIVERS WHAT THEY NEED
TO KNOW.  "Some mothers just dump their youngster here in the morning
and run off to work, then grab him at pickup time and hurry away,"
reported one caregiver.  "SO I'M LEFT NOT KNOWING WHAT KIND OF NIGHT
THE CHILD HAD OR WHETHER SOMETHING IMPORTANT HAS HAPPENED IN THE
FAMILY THAT WOULD AFFECT HIS FEELINGS."

2nd paragraph
Some caregivers complain that mothers even fail to mention that they
are going off on vacation and leaving their child with a relative or
friend.  "IF I KNEW IN ADVANCE," ONE CAREGIVER EXPLAINED, "I WOULD BE
PREPARED TO HELP THE CHILD IF SHE BECAME WEEPY, SAD OR CONFUSED."

2nd column	3rd paragraph
WHAT TO DO?  WHEN YOU THINK IT'S TIME FOR A CHANGE IN YOUR CHILD'S
ROUTINE, CALL AND MAKE AN APPOINTMENT TO TALK OVER THE MATTER FIRST.
Try to find an approach both you and your caregiver can live with-
then stick with your end of the bargain.

3rd column	1st paragraph
Providers also say that sick children jeopardize the caregivers' own
health- and they can't afford to miss a day's work any more than other
parents can.  Nevertheless, caregivers sympathize with a mother who
must get to work even though her child doesn't feel well.
Unfortunately, they don't a solution for this problem.  THEY JUST
BELIEVE THAT IT'S NOT THEIR JOB TO CARE FOR SICK CHILDREN.

2nd paragraph
WHAT TO DO?  It's impossible to plan for a child's sickness.  PERHAPS
A DISCUSSION WITH YOUR BOSS WILL RESULT IN THINKING ABOUT WAYS TO PLAN
FOR TIMES WHEN YOUR CHILD IS ILL.  Perhaps you could work at home on
those days.  THE POINT IS TO THINK IN ADVANCE ABOUT WHAT YOU WILL DO.

Subheader:
THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COIN

pg. 79		1st column	1st paragraph
BEEF #1:  "SHE DOESN'T APPROVE OF ME!"  MANY PARENTS WRESTLE WITH
GUILT WHEN THEY LEAVE A YOUNG CHILD IN SOMEONE ELSE'S CARE.  As one
mother told me, "It's easy to be paranoid about the parenting job you
are doing, especially when you feel that someone is checking up on
you."  Mothers are especially sensitive to criticism.  ONE WOMAN WHO
DRESSED HER BABY LIGHTLY ON A WARM DAY SAID, "I FELT INTIMIDATED AND
ANGRY WHEN THE CAREGIVER INSISTED THAT SARA NEEDED A SWEATER.  I KNOW
MY KID AND WHAT'S BEST FOR HER."

2nd paragraph
IN FACT, IT'S NOT EVEN UNUSUAL FOR A CAREGIVER TO DISAPPROVE OF A
WOMAN'S LEAVING HER INFANT OR TODDLER IN CHILD CARE IN ORDER TO WORK.
THAT FEELING SEESM TO COLOR HER OPINION OF THE MOTHER'S PARENTING
ABILITIES.  A friend of mine told me that her provider commented,
"You're just going back to work so you can buy a new car."

3rd paragraph
WHAT TO DO?  IT'S HARD TO AVOID FEELING TURMOIL WHEN SOMEONE
CRITICIZES YOU.  Do your best to cool off before you respond to
criticism, whether direct or implied.  Talk it over with a friend
first.  She's probably had a similar experience.  THEN AIM FOR
NEGOTIATION WITH THE CAREGIVER RATHER THAN CONFRONTATION.  Make it
clear that you'd like her to provide care as close as possible to
yours.  IF SHE CONTINUES TO BE JUDGMENTAL AND YOU FEEL IT IS BECAUSE
SHE DOESN'T APPROVE OF YOUR WORKING, YOU MIGHT SAY SOMETHING LIKE
THIS:  "I FEEL YOU HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT MY PARENTING STYLE.  IN WONDER
IF IT'S BECAUSE I'M LEAVING SUCH A YOUNG BABY WITH YOU SO I CAN WORK."
Wait for her answer.  If she seems understanding, you can probably
talk the situation through.  Try not to be defensive.  GIVE HER THE
BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT, BUT IF TIME GOES BY AND YOU STILL FEEL SHE HAS A
DEEP-SEATED RESENTMENT TOWARD YOU, IT WOULD BE WISE TO LOOK FOR
SOMEONE WHO WILL OFFER YOU MORE SUPPORT.

4th paragraph
BEEF #2:  "I DON'T LIKE HER IDEAS ABOUT DISCIPLINE."  A mother
recently confided that while her family day care provider had been
wonderful when her son was an infant, she tended to be too restrictive
now that he was a toddler.  "I'M NOT HAPPY THAT SHE'S ALWAYS SAYING NO
TO HIM- AND EVEN `BAD BOY,' BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.  This is a
common problem.  FREQUENTLY CAREGIVERS ARE TOO NEGATIVE TO TODDLERS
WHO ARE, BY NATURE, CURIOUS ABOUT THE WORLD AND WANT TO TOUCH
EVERYTHING THEY SEE.  They are sometimes made to sit in a "time-out"
chair simply for exploring.  Punishment in that case is really
inappropriate.

5th paragraph to top of 2nd column
WHAT TO DO?  Deal with the gripe right away.  DON'T LET GRIEVANCES
PILE UP- YOU RUN THE RISK THAT THEY MAY FLOOD OUT LATER OVER SOME
TRIVIAL INCIDENT.

2nd column	1st paragraph
The winning approach lies in looking together for the answer to a
particular problem.  Try this:  First, describe the problem without
blaming anyone.  SAY "MY CHILD IS UNHAPPY THAT HE HAS TO SPEND SO MUCH
TIME SITTING STILL.  HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND WHY HE CAN'T PLAY WITH
CERTAIN THINGS."  Let your caregiver offer a solution; if you like it,
fine.  IF NOT, SEE IF SHE'LL CONSIDER YOUR SUGGESTION.

2nd paragraph to top of 3rd column
Here's the bottom line- you can look the other way on some issues, but
for things you care about, you've got to take a stand.  DECIDE WHICH
ONES AREN'T WORTH FIGHTING ABOUT.  Whether your child watches a little
TV, for example, may be less important than whether she is punished
for something as natural as investigating her immediate surroundings.

3rd column	1st paragraph to top of pg. 81
BEEF #3:  "SHE NEVER TAKES TIME TO TALK WITH ME."  MANY MOTHERS FEEL
THAT IT'S SO HECTIC AT DELIVERY AND PICKUP TIMES, THERE'S NO CHANCE
FOR AN EXCHANGE WITH THE CAREGIVER.  She is often distracted by
helping the children or by other parents.  One friend said, "I can't
take the time in the morning and chance being late for work.  After
work, my son doesn't have the patience to hang around while I try to
get his teacher's attention."

pg. 81		1st column	2nd paragraph
BEEF #4:  "I WISH OUR CENTER WASN'T SO PICKY ABOUT MILD ILLNESSES."
Many parents complain about the stress they're under when their child
gets slightly sick.  "The worst times," a mother told me, "are when my
son throws up at six a.m. or my daughter wakes up with a runny nose.
I KNOW THEY'RE NOT SERIOUSLY ILL, BUT THE CENTER GIVES ME A HARD TIME.
And since these minor upsets happen with my kids all the time, I can't
keep them home every time they're a little under the weather."

3rd paragraph to top of 2nd paragraph
WHAT TO DO?  BEFORE YOU ARRANGE TO SEND YOUR CHILD TO A PARTICULAR
CENTER, FIND OUT WHAT THE RULES ARE FOR DEALING WITH SICKNESS.
Usually, centers will not accept children with a fever of 101 degrees
or over, children who have diarrhea or children who have been
vomiting.

2nd column	2nd paragraph
BEEF #5:  "I'M WORRIED MY CHILD WILL LOVE HER MORE THAN ME."  MANY
MOTHERS I SPOKE TO WONDERED IF THEIR CHILDREN WOULD BECOME OVERLY
ATTACHED TO THEIR CAREGIVER.  "I HOPE MY DAUGHTER WON'T FORGET THAT
I'M HER MOTHER," SAID ONE PARENT.  Sometimes kids in family day care
homes even call the caregiver "Mommy" or "Mommy Alice."  No wonder
mothers secretly feel heartbroken.

3rd paragraph
WHAT TO DO?  FIRST OF ALL, REST ASSURED THAT YOUR CHILD WILL NEVER BE
CONFUSED AOUT WHO HIS PARENTS ARE.  CHILDREN FEEL ATTACHED TO THEIR
PARENTS EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE CARED FOR BY SOMEONE ELSE.  Don't worry-
you will not be usurped!

3rd column	1st paragraph
And don't forget that your child's affection for the caregiver is a
sign that he's happy with her.  THAT SHOULD GIVE YOU PEACE OF MIND.
DON'T BE SURPRISED, THOUGH, IF ONCE IN A WHILE YOU FEEL A LITTLE
COMPETITIVE- IT'S PERFECTLY NATURAL.

Subheader:
AIM FOR TEAMWORK

2nd paragraph
LEARNING TO WORK TOGETHER ISN'T EASY.  IT DEMANDS GOOD FAITH AND
MUTUAL RESPECT BASED ON A BELIEF IN THE OTHER PERSON'S COMPETENCE.  It
means working hard at communication- being honest, friendly and open.

3rd paragraph
SO DON'T LET A BEEF COME TO A BOIL.  Set yourself to creating a true
partnership with your caregiver.  This takes time, but it can be done
if you meet each other halfway.  Teamwork will produce the best
possible care for your child.  And you can start bringing it about
today!

1st column	1st paragraph
WHEN YOU BELIEVE IN GOOD, SOUND NUTRITION AS MUCH AS ROMAN MEAL DOES,
YOU KNOW THAT GOOD EATING HABITS START WHEN YOU'RE YOUNG.

2nd paragraph
SEVENTY-FIVE YEARS AGO, WE KNEW THT YOUR BODY NEEDED ROUGHAGE FOR A
HEALTHY DIGESTIVE SYSTEM.  Today it's called insoluble fiber.  And
you'll still find a good, healthy amount of it in the wheat bran we
use in Roman Meal bread.

2nd column	1st paragraph
OF COURSE, IF YOU WANT YOUR KIDS TO GET FIBER, YOU'D BETTER MAKE SURE
IT TASTES GOOD.  That's one reason why we still use honey in our
breads.  The other's because we like it ourselves.

Title:  Taking the Kids Cruising
Subheader:  SHIPS THAT CATER TO FAMILIES MAKE VACATIONS AT SEA EASY,
	FUN AND AFFORDABLE!
By:  Sarah Hutter

1st column	3rd paragraph
Cruising has become a family affair.  The all-inclusing price, the
special reduced rates for children and the long list of of on-board
activities for kids and parents alike have made family vacations on
the high seas affordable and fun.  In fact, families are now the
industry's best customers.  In a survey conducted by the Cruise Lines
International Association (CLIA) in New York City, 91 percent of the
people who brought their kids with them on a sea voyage rated their
vacation as extremely satisfying.  THIS MAY EXPLAIN WHY THE NUMBER OF
FAMILIES WHO CHOOSE TO CRUISE HAS INCREASED BY 15 PERCENT IN THE LAST
TWO YEARS- AND IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE EVEN MORE.

pg. 100		1st column	3rd paragraph
Some cruise lines cater to families more than others.  SO IF YOU'RE
THINKING OF TAKING TO THE SEAS FOR YOUR NEXT VACATION, DO PLENTY OF
RESEARCH BEFORE YOU MAKE RESERVATIONS.  There are questions you should
ask and things to consider.

2nd column	3rd paragraph
TRAVEL OFF-SEASON.  If you avoid the summer months and holidays when
scheduling your vacation, you can take advantage of special off-season
rates.  Ships are less crowded then, which can be nice.  BUT CONSIDER,
TOO, THAT TRAVELING WHILE SCHOOL IS IN SESSION MEANS FEWER KIDS WILL
BE ON BOARD.  On some lines this may result i cutbacks or even
cancellation of the youth program.

6th paragraph
PREPARE FOR HIDDEN EXPENSES.  Drinks from the bar, on shore excursions
and babysitting cost extra.  YOU'LL ALSO BE EXPECTED TO TIP YOUR ROOM
STEWARD, DINING-ROOM WAITER, BUSBOY AND MAITRE D' ROUGHLY $3 EACH PER
ADULT PER DAY.

BE KID-CONSCIOUS

pg. 101		1st column	2nd paragraph
ASK ABOUT THE AGE BREAKDOWN OF THE YOUTH PROGRAM.  Some lump kids
under 13 in one group and teens in another, which can pose problems if
your 10-year-old doesn't want to be stuck with a preschooler.  IF
YOU'VE GOT A TODDLER IN TOW, FIND OUT WHAT THE MINIMUM AGE REQUIREMENT
IS FOR THE KIDS' PROGRAM- IN MANY CASES, IT'S FOUR.  YOU ALSO NEED TO
KNOW WHETHER THE YOUTH PROGRAM IS A YEAR-ROUND FEATURE OR ONE THAT
OPERATES ONLY WHEN A CERTAIN NUMBER OF YOUNGSTERS ARE ON BOARD.  Is
there a youth center that serves a home base?  Find out its hours.
Some close midafternoon, while others operate until late at night.

3rd paragraph
GET INFORMATION ON BABYSITTERS.  A limited number of sitters are
available on most ships, and usually on a first come, first served
basis.  Ask if they'll look after a child during the day as well as at
night- an important question if yours is too young for the youth
program.  AND FIND OUT WHETHER SITTERS PROVIDE CABIN SERVICE OR ARE
CONFINED TO PUBLIC AREAS.

4th paragraph
BABIES ON BOARD POSE SPECIAL PROBLEMS.  IF YOU HAVE AN INFANT, SEE IF
THE SHIP HS A DROP-IN NURSERY.  Big liners, like Cunard's Queen
Elizabeth 2, do, but most ships don't.  You'll also to need to know if
cribs, high chairs and booster seats are available (be sure to reserve
such equipment in advance) and if the ship's store sells formula,
diapers and wipes.  ALSO CHECK TO SEE IF CABIN LAVATORIES HAVE
BATHTUBS.

5th paragraph to top of 2nd column
GET THE FACTS ON FOOD.  Generally, ships have enough of a variety to
please even picky eaters.  WHEN YOU MAKE RESERVATIONS, YOU'LL NEED TO
DECIDE WHAT TIME YOU'LL WANT TO EAT DINNER.  Some lines, like Cunard,
have special early seatings for kids, allowing parents to eat by
themselves later.  KMost others require families to dine together.

Title:  Why Are The Holidays Such A Headache?
Subheader:  I'M GOING TO CONCENTRATE ON MY FAMILY, INSTEAD OF
	FRANTICALLY RUNNING AROUND
By:  Roberta Israeloff

1st column	1st paragraph
Right after Thanksgiving, conversations with my children begin to
sound like this:  "Jason is getting his own television set for
Christmas.  Tim and his family are going to Disney World."

2nd paragraph
"THOSE PRESENTS ARE PRETTY SPLASHY," I TELL MY SONS, AGES NINE AND
THREE, REMINDING THEM THAT IN OUR FAMILY WE'VE WORKED OUT A FORMULA-
ONE BIG PRESENT ON THE FIRST NIGHT OF HANUKKAH, AND SEVEN LITTLE ONES
AFTER THAT.  But even our first-day gifts aren't televisions or trips.
"The holidays aren't just about getting things," I say next.  "They're
about family and friends and peace and rebirth and miracles."

4th paragraph
AND LATER, AT NIGHT, WHEN I CAN'T SLEEP, I REALIZE THAT I'VE BEEN A
FRIGHTFUL FAILURE AT IMBUING MY CHILDREN WITH THE TRUE MEANING OF THE
HOLIDAYS.  WORSE, I KNOW WHY I FAILED.  During the holidays, I forget
to "stay within myself."

5th paragraph
THAT'S THE PHRASE ATHLETES OFTEN USE REMINDING THEMSELVES TO RESIST
THE TEMPTATION TO OVERREACH, TO OVEREXTEND- TO WILDLY SWING FOR THE
HOME RUN WHEN YOU KNOW YOU'RE A SINGLES HITTER, TO PRESS FOR THE SLAM
DUNK WHEN YOU KNOW YOUR FORTE IS DEFENSE.  IN OTHER WORDS, THE GOAL IS
TO BE SATISFIED DOING WHAT YOU DO BEST.

6th paragraph to top of 2nd column
The holidays were always an intensely personal time for me.  Years
ago, when I was single, I spent the season singing in various choirs;
to reach out through music was a transporting experience.  After I
ment my husband, I gave up choral singing so I could be at home rather
than out every night during the holidays, but I found other ways to
keep active:  I threw myself intomaking gifts- afghans, sweaters,
scarves, breads and cookies.  I ALSO BEGAN DESIGNING HOLIDAY CARDS,
WHICH GAVE ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO FEEL I WAS VISITING WITH EACH OF MY
FRIENDS.

2nd column	1st paragraph
But ever since my children were born, the holiday season has become
less personal and more hectic.  EVERY YEAR, DESPITE MY RESOLUTIONS TO
THE CONTRARY, I FIND MYSELF GETTING CAUGHT UP IN A FRANTIC PACE.  I
THROW AND ATTEND PARTIES, I THINK OF PRESENTS TO BUY, EMBARK ON LONG
SHOPPING EXPEDITIONS, TAKE CLOTHES AND TOYS TO THE PEOPLE WHO DON'T
HAVE ENOUGH OF THEIR OWN- CONVINCING MYSELF THAT I AM SETTING A GOOD
EXAMPLE FOR MY CHILDREN, SHOWING THEM HOW TIRELESS I CAN BE IN THE
SERVICE OF FAMILY AND FRIENDS.

2nd paragraph
Of course, I am far from tireless.  The round of activities exhausts
me.  Our family has less impromptu time together than at any other
season.  I SNAP AT THE KIDS MORE THAN I MEAN TO.  AND I WAKE UP ONE
MORNING IN JANUARY, THE MOST DESOLATE TIME OF YEAR, FEELING HOLLOW:
THE KIDS ARE BACK IN SCHOOL, THE HOLIDAYS OVER.

3rd paragraph
THEN I HAVE PLENT OF TIME TO SIFT THROUGH WHAT WENT WRONG.  AND I
THINK THAT THE ANSWER IS NOT SIMPLY THAT I DID TOO MUCH, BUT THAT I
DID SO FOR THE WRONG REASONS.  IN PART, I FEARED LETTING GO OF MY
HOLIDAY TRADITION OF ACTIVITY.  After all, what's a tradition if not
that which stays constant through the years?  YET DWELLING ON WHAT I
SHOULD DO, WHAT IS USED TO DO, MAKES ME FORGET WHAT I FEEL LIKE DOING.
NOW I SEE THAT TRADITIONS MUST ALWAYS RESPOND TO CHANGES IN OUR
EMOTIONAL PALLETTE; OTHERWISE, THEY DRY UP AND BECOME MERE OBLIGATION.

3rd column	1st paragraph
PERHAPS MY GREATER FEAR WAS IN ACKNOWLEDGING THAT BECAUSE OF MY
CHILDREN MY PHYSICAL ENERGY HAS DIMINISHED.  But if indeed my sights
have narrowed, they have also deepened.  Having children has enabled
me to understand the holidays as I never did before.

3rd paragraph
Still, I need to remind myself, the oil didn't burn forever; it ran
its course and burned itself out.  WHAT THIS MEANS TO ME IS THAT
MOTHERS HAVE TO BECOME MORE PROTECTIVE OF THEIR OWN TIME, OR THEIR
CHILDREN WILL GROW UP NOT KNOWING THAT ACTIVITY NEEDS TO BE THE
COUNTERBALANCE F REFLECTION- THAT AS THE DAYS GROW SHORTER, AS THE
YEAR RUSHES TO A CLOSE, WE HAVE A RARE OPPORTUNITY TO REFLECT ON WHAT
HAS HAPPENED AND WHAT IS TO COME.

4th paragraph
THAT I BE WITH MY CHILDREN DURING THE HOLIDAYS THIS YEAR- THAT I
RESIST MY TEMPTATION TO GET CAUGHT UP IN THE HOLIDAY MADNESS- FEELS
MORE URGENT THAN EVER.  Soon I'll have enough time on my hands to join
a local choir, or to make cards again.

5th paragraph
BUT THIS YEAR, INSTEAD OF PARTYING, BAKING, SHOPPING AND VISITING,
WHAT I'LL DO IS PULL MY CHILDREN CLOSE, AND WHO THEM THROUGH MY OWN 
HEARTFELT EXAMPLE THAT THE HOLIDAYS HAVE VERY LITTLE TO DO WITH GIVING 
OR RECEIVING; THAT THEY ARE LESS AN EVENT THAN A FRAME OF MIND; THAT
THEY ARE NOT ABOUT DOING, BUT ABOUT BEING- BEING TOGETHER, BEING AT
PEACE.
