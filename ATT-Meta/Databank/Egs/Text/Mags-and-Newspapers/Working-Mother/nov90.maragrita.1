Title:  The Comfort and Joy of Family Rituals
Subheader:  TRADITIONS BRING US CLOSER AND CREATE THE STUFF OF
	MEMORIES
By: Dena K. Salmon

1st column	1st paragraph to top of pg. 50
SAY THE WORD "RITUAL" AND YOU ARE LIKELY TO CONJURE UP IMAGES OF A
MYSTERIOUS ANCIENT RITE WHERE EVERY PHRASE AND MOTION HAS BEEN USED
FOR CENTURIES.  IN FAMILIES, HOWEVER, NEW RITUALS CAN BE BORN DAILY,
IN A FLASH OF SHEER INSPIRATION- OR SOMETIMES OUT OF DESPERATION.  MY
FRIEND BARBARA LIKES TO RECALL ONE SUCH FAMILY RITUAL THAT WAS CREATED
ON A CHRISTMAS EVE WHEN SHE AND HER FOUR BROTHERS WERE RUNNING WILE
THROUGH THE HOUSE.  My mother, at her wit's end grabbed hold of us,
stuffed us into our snowsuits and boots, and ordered us into the
station wagon.  IN A RATHER TERRIBLE VOICE, SHE ANNOUNCED THAT WE WERE
GOING TO WISH ON THE CHRISTMAS STAR, AND ANY CHILD WHO WANTED A
SPECIAL WISH GRANTED HAD BETTER COME ALONG.  She and my father took us
on a long, cold drive through the country until we reached an open
field that was utterly silent and covered with snow.  WE ALL WALKED
OUT INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE FIELD, QUIETLY BREATHING IN THE PEACEFUL
SCENE, FULL OF ANTICIPATION.  My mother explained that on Christmas
Eve, the wishing star appeared.  IF WE FOUND THIS STAR AND MADE OUR
WISH, IT WOULD CERTAINLY BE GRANTED.  We each picked the brightest
astar in a sky that seemed filled with a million possiblities and then
we drove home, singing Christmas carols all the way.  THE ADVENTURE
ENDED WITH CINNAMON TOAST AND HOT CHOCOLATE IN THE KITCHEN, AND WE ALL
WENT TO BED WONDERING WHETHER OUR WISHES WOULD COME TRUE."

Subheader:
THE HEART OF RITUALS

2nd column	1st paragraph
THE FEELING OF BELONGING THAT ALL OF THIS ENGENDERS IS AS HEADY AS
BEING ONE OF THE "IN" CROWD DURING HIGH SCHOOL.  "CHILDREN THRIVE ON
THE SENSE THAT THEY ARE PART OF A SPECIAL GROUP THAT IS
DISTINGUISHABLE FROM ALL OTHERS," OBSERVES ZEITLIN.  SHARING A FAMILY
JOKE OR HEARING A PARENT USE A PHRASE THAT THE CHILD HAS INVENTED
GIVES A KID A GREAT FEELING OF BEING INCLUDED."

2nd paragraph
Family rituals can also make difficult everyday transitions, such as
saying good night, more bearable.  "A bedtime ritual helps children
make the transition from conscious life into the dream world," says
Janine Roberts, EdD, associate professor in family therapy at the
University of Massachusetts, and co-editor of Rituals in Families and
Family Therapy (Norton).  "It helps children make the separation from
their parents and provides comfort," Roberts explains.  "NEARLY EVERY
CHILD FINDS IT SOOTHING TO KNOW EXACTLY HOW HE AND MOMMY WILL BEHAVE
WHEN IT'S TIME TO GO TO BED.  First, he'll have a bath and brush his
teeth.  Then he'll hear two stories.  After that, a good-night kiss
and lights out."  The sameness of the ritual carries comfort, security
and the unspoken message that since the end of the day is predictable,
the orning will be predictable too.  Parents and child will all be
there to greet each other after successfully weathering the night.

Subheader:
YOU SAY GOODBYE, I'LL SAY HELLO

3rd column	2nd paragraph
Although it is unlikely that those two families will ever find a
comfortable way to greet each other, ritual behavior in families can
and does change over time.  ACCORDING TO JOAN LAIRD, MSW, PROFESSOR OF
SOCIAL WORK AT SMITH COLLEGE AND FAMILY THERAPIST IN PRIVATE PRACTICE,
WE NEED TO BE AWARE OF WHICH PARTS OF OUR RITUALS REMAIN MEANINGFUL
AND WHICH MIGHT BE ALTERED.  "If a ritual is rigidly adhered to
despite the changed going on in a familyk, the ritual will be a
negative force,: Laird says.  "However, if all members of the family
are able to adapt to or even turn away from `worn-out' rituals, new
and equally meaningful ones will evolve."  Thus, the important bedtime
ritual will be thrust aside when the child no longer fears the night,
and a teenager will forgo the traditional Saturday bagel supper in
favor of going out with friends.

3rd paragraph
CHILDREN CAN COME UP WITH SURPRISINGLY CREATIVE WAYS OF ALTERING OR
ADAPTING A FAMILY RITUAL.  When Darlene Kaczmarczyk and her sister
were in high schol, they rebelled against going to church on Sunday
and secretly relaed mass with a new ritual.  UNBEKNOWNST TO THEIR
PARENTS, THEY WOULD DRIVE TO THE DETROIT INSTITUTE OF ART RATHER THAN
CHURCH AND SPEND AN HOUR CONTEMPLATING A BEAUTIFULLY LIGHTED ROOM
RILLED WITH DIEGO RIVERA MURALS.  "MY PARENTS WOULD HAVE A STROKE IF
THEY HAD KNOWN, YET OUR RIVERA-WATCHING RITUAL WAS COMPLETELY
SPIRITUAL IN ITS OWN WAY," SAYS DARLENE.

FOOD IS A CENTRAL FEATURE

pg. 52		2nd column	2nd paragraph
Not everyone has such an elaborage set of family activities or
traditions, but most people do have rituals that connect them to their
famiy history.  For one woman, the family connection is made with a
can of cranberry sauce.  "My mother wasn't much of a cook- the turkey
was always nearly raw or burnt, the stuffing was inedible- but we
could always depend on Ocean Spray.  IT BECAME A FAMILY JOKE, AND NOW
I CANNOT CONTEMPLATE A THANKSGIVING DINNER WITHOUT THOSE PERFECT
ROUNDS OF JELLIED CRANBERRY.  This is what makes me feel like home.  I
never go to anyone's Thanksgiving dinner without a can of cranberry
sauce in my purse, just in case the hosts serve only fancy relishes or
homemade sauce," she admits with a sheepish laugh.

Subheader:
WHEN TRADITIONS MUST CHANGE

3rd column	2nd paragraph
One way to keep rituals meaningful is to involve the entire family as
much as possible.  I KNOW OF A LARGE SOUTHERN FAMILY WHO ALWAYS
CELEBRATED CHRISTMAS WITH A HUGE DINNER, THE ADULTS AT ONE TABLE AND
THE KIDS AT ANOTHER.  But the segregation didn't stop at age- the
family served two separate Christmas dinners.  The adults tucked into
the usual ham, sweet potatoes, biscuits and brown gravy, but the
children were allowed to create and prepare their own menu- with no
adult veto allowed.  One year, the kids invented an all-chocolate
menu:  chocolate-syrup soup accompanied by chocolate-covered graham
crackers, white and dark chocolate-dipped orange slices with a side
dish of Milk Duds, and chocolate cake for dessert.  No matter that
every child became slightly ill from this feast.  These were children
of nutritionists, sworn off white flower and refined sugar for most of
the year, and no amount of stomach upset could take away from the
sweet taste of freedom.  Christmas Day meant family participation,
nutritional anarchy and complete gustatory satisfaction.

3rd paragraph
Rituals like these are part of the glue that holds a family together,
a way of communicating intimacy and love and security.  They define us
as culture, as a family and as individuals; they change as we change.
BUT WHATEVER FORM THEY TAKE, FAMILY RITUALS ARE A WONDERFUL GIFT THAT
WE GIVE TO OURSELVES:  A CONSTANT, RENEWING SENSE OF WHO WE ARE.

Title:  How Babies Fall In Love
Subheader:  DON'T BELIEVE THE MYTHS YOU HEAR ABOUT BONDING.  HERE'S
	HOW THE TIES BETWEEN A MOTHER AND A BABY TRULY FORM
By:  Eva Conrad

1st column	1st paragraph
"When I went into labor I remember thinking, `Finally, I'll be able to
see my baby!'  I was so eager for that wonderous moment of bonding.
Just me and my baby in a glow of true love.  Everything in the delivery
room was perfect.  I had the right doctor, the right music and my
husband by my side.  Everything was just the way we'd planned- except
my feelings.  I was more exhausted than I had ever been before.
Holding my baby should have been one of the greatest events in my
life, but when they placed Eric on my abdomen, there was no magic
spark.  AT THAT MOMENT I HAD THE AWFUL FEELING THAT I WOULD BE A
TERRIBLE MOTHER."
			-Patsy, age 25

2nd paragraph
"My daughter Amy was in intensive care for two weeks after she was
born, so I never got to bond with her.  I think that's why we're
having these battles now that Amy is four."
			-Melissa, age 31

3rd paragraph
LIKE PATSY AND MELISSA, MANY WOMEN HAVE DOUBTS ABOUT THEIR ABILITY TO
BE PROPER MOTHERS BECAUSE THEY DID NOT "BOND" WITH THEIR INFANTS IN
THE FIRST FEW HOURS AFTER BIRTH.  But once you separate the facts and
fiction about bonding, it becomes clear that forging a strong
emotional bond with your infant doesn't take place in any one magical
moment but over the course of many ordinary days in which you get to
know and love your new baby.  The process is slower, but also simpler
and more pleasurable than you may have imagined.

4th paragraph to top of pg. 58
The advocates of bonding argue that an intense, lifelong emotional tie
forms btween a mother and her baby during the first moments of
skin-to-skin contact after childbirth.  The notion of bonding took
shape in the 1940s as a reaction against the sterile hospital practice
of whisking newborns away from their mothers right after birth.
BONDING EVOLVED AS PART OF THE "NATURAL CHILDBIRTH" MOVEMENT, WHOSE
AIM WAS TO MAKE THE PARENTS AND CHILD, RATHER THAN THE HOSPITAL STAFF,
THEKEY PLAYERS IN THE CHILDBIRTH PROCESS.  And it worked.  This
back-to-basics approach to childbirth has reversed some intrusive
hospital procedures.  Parents are now encouraged to hold their babies
immediately after birth, get acquainted and assume as much of the
baby's care as possible during the hospital stay.  Many hospitals
instituted the practice of rooming-in- supported by such authorities
as Drs. Benjamin Spock and Grantly Dick-Read, author of Childbirth
Without Fear (Harper & Row)- as one way to promote bonding.

Subheader:
BONDING MYTHS AROUSE GUILT

pg. 58		1st column	2nd paragraph
Those first moments after birth often can't live up to expectations.
Nine Barrett, author of I Wish Someone Had Told Me (Simon & Schuster),
interviewed 63 new mothers and discovered that their experiences
rarely matched the lovely pictures painted by books and medical
experts.  "There is an outrageous amount of pressure to make bonding
happen," says Barrett.  FOR EXAMPLE, ONE COUPLE TOOK TURNS WALKING AND
HOLDING THEIR INFANT FOR THE FIRST THREE DAYS AND NIGHTS THEY WERE
HOME ROM THE HOSPITAL BECAUSE THEY BELIEVED THAT A BABY MUST BE
ENCIRCLED BY HUMAN ARMS FOR SEVERAL DAYS IN ORDER TO BECOME BONDED.
"There is no prescription for how to bond, and such
`just-follow-the-instructions' approaches to emotions are almost
always destined to fail," Barrett says.

3rd paragraph
In a study of bonding led by John Pascoe, MD, at the University of
Wisconsin Hospital and Clinics department of pediatrics, most of the
mothers (81 percent) spent the first hour after childbirth holding
their infant.  But only a few of these women felt a surge of intense
"love" or "bonding" during that hour.  The mothers' feelings depended
on many factors other than the simple contact with their newborns.
THEIR DESIRE TO HAVE A CHILD, THE LENGTH OF LABOR, THEIR FATIGUE OR
DROWSINESS DUE TO ANESTHETICS AND THE PRESENCE OF THEIR PARTNERS IN
THE DELIVERY ROOM ALL STRONGLY COLORED THE MOTHERS' FEELINGS OF LOVE
AND JOY.

Subheader:
THE EVIDENCE AGAINST INSTANT BONDING

2nd column	3rd paragraph
Every adopted child who is loved and grows into a loving adult is
another testimony against the notion that hormones cause mothers- and
fathers- to feel close to their children.  OBSERVES DR. SCARR, "I HAVE
ALSO SEEN NORMALLY DELIVERED INFANTS WHOSE MOTHERS WERE NOT
ENTHUSIASTIC IN THE SLIGHTEST ABOUT GETTING TO KNOW THEIR BABIES.  The
mother-infant relationship begins in the first days of life, but it
has a long way to go from there."

6th paragraph to the top of 3rd column
But the process of forming human attachments is not as simple as
imprinting.  "PARENTS WHO ARE SEPARATED FROM THEIR BABIES AT FIRST
BECAUSE THEY ARE BORN PREMATURELY OR WITH A SERIOUS ILLNESS DO NOT
HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT FORMING A SOLID ATTACHMENT," SAYS SHERI HAWKINS, A
NURSE MANAGER OF THE NEWBORN INTENSIVE-CARE UNIT AT LOMA LINDA MEDICAL
CENTER IN CALIFORNIA.  "After-birth bonding is not essential for
developing a successful long-term relationship."

3rd column	1st paragraph
TODAY, MOST PROFESSINALS REGARD THE ORIGINAL IDEAS OF HUMAN BONDING
WITH DISDAIN.  "IT IS ABSURD TO THINK THAT YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH YOUR
BABY MIGHT FALTER OR FAIL BECAUSE NO LIGHTNING BOLT BONDED YOU
TOGETHER ON THE DELIVERY TABLE," SAYS PENELOPE LEACH, PHD, IN YOUR
BABY AND CHILD:  FROM BIRTH TO AGE FIVE (ALFRED A KNOPF).

2nd paragraph
"I DISPUTE THE NOTION THAT THERE IS ONE MOMENT TO BOND.  I DISAGREE
THAT, AS THE WORD SUGGESTS, THERE IS AN EPOXY GLUELIKE FUSION BINDING
TOGETHER MOTHER OR FATHER AND CHILD," WRITES ELLEN GALINSKY, PAST
PRESIDENT OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR THE EDUCATION OF YOUNG
CHILDREN, IN THE PRESCHOOL YEARS (TIMES BOOKS).

THE THREE ROOTS OF ATTACHMENT

GETTING ACQUAINTED

pg. 60		3rd column	3rd paragraph
AT FIRST, YOUR BABY IS A STRANGER YOU NEED TO GET TO KNOW.  Some
babies are quick to awaken, and others start the day slowly.  Some are
curious, always moving and looking about, while others have a narrower
range of focus.  Some are easily soothed, and others are colicky.
REGARDLESS OF YOUR BABY'S TEMPERAMENT, THE FIRST STEP IN ESTABLISHING
AN ATTACHMENT IS TO UNDERSTAND AND RESPECT YOUR BABY'S OWN UNIQUE
RHYTHM, SAY T. BERRY BRAZELTON, MD, AND BERTRAND CRAMER, MD,
PEDIATRICIANS AND COAUTHORS OF THE EARLIEST RELATIONSHIP
(ADDISON-WESLEY).

pg. 62		1st column	1st paragraph
AS YOU BECOME FAMILIAR WITH YOUR BABY'S NEEDS AND RHTHM AND AS YOU
GIVE HER WHAT SHE NEEDS, SHE WILL FEEL SAFE AND SECURE.  "It is in the
everyday moments of infancy- of holding, feeding, exchanging smiles
and looks- that attachments takes root.  It is in the everyday moments
of the preschool years- of talking and playing together- that
attachment grows strong.  It is in the everyday moments throughout
childhood that this relationship is formed through the inevitale
periods of holding on, letting go and coming together in new ways,"
observes Galinsky.

Subheader:
EXPECT SOME AMBIVALENCE

2nd column	1st paragraph
Life with a new baby- as with any person- has ups and downs.  The
ambivalence you can expect to feel is not a myth.  "I FOUND MYSELF
CALLING MY HUSBAND AT THE OFFICE AND SAYING, `SHE'S SCREAMING AND I
CAN'T STAND IT ANYMORE.  Could you please just come home and take
her!'" says one of the mothers profiled in Barrett's book.

2nd paragraph
YOU'LL WANT TO BE WITH YOUR CHILD, AND YET YOU'LL HAVE FANTASIES OF
ESCAPING.  But do not misinterpret your feelings- this desire to take
a break does not mean you don't love your baby or that you're an
inadequate parent.

3rd paragraph
"Crying at the end of the day often serves as a necessary outlet and
discharge for a baby's nervous system after an exciting but
overwhelming day," says Dr. Brazelton.  "THIS CRYING CAN EASILY BE
PERCEIVED AS A SIGN OF FAILURE BY HARASSED, INEXPERIENCED PARENTS."
But you are not failing, Brazelton says.  YOU'RE JUST FOLLOWING THE
SLOW PROCESS OF GETTING TO KNOW YOUR CHILD.

4th paragraph to top of 3rd column
WHILE IT IS EASY TO FEEL PERSONALLY COMPETENT AND EMOTIONALLY "IN
LOVE" WITH A QUIET, CALM BABY WHO SMILES AND "TALKS" TO YOU, PARENTS
OF COLICKY BABIES OFTEN FEEL WOEFULLY INADEQUATE.  "Colic is a
terrifying introduction to parenthood, guaranteed tomake you and your
husband feel helpless, incompetent and exhausted," says Barrett.  "And
the unfortunate fact is that there's no safe, reliable cure other than
waiting until that magical point when the baby simply outgrows it."

WORKING- EVEN RELUCTANTLY- CUTS STRESS

1st column	1st paragraph
WOMEN WHO SAY THEY'D RATHER STAY AT HOME WITH THEIR CHILDREN BUT WHO
GO OUT TO WORK ANYWAY WIND UP FEELING FULFILLED AND DOING WELL IN BOTH
ROLES, ACCORDING TO A STUDY BY PSYCHOLOGISTS AT OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY
AND HOBART AND WILLIAM SMITH COLLEGES IN GENEVA, NEW YORK.  In
contrast, women who stay at home with their children but would rather
be ou working experience higher levels of depression than the other
group.

2nd paragraph
THE RESEARCHERS FOLLOWED 164 NEW MOTHERS TO SEE HOW THE DECISION TO
STAY HOME (AFTER MATERNITY LEAVE HAD ELAPSED) OR RETURN TO FULL-TIME
WORK AFFECTS A MOTHER'S MENTAL HEALTH.  They interviewed the women
after delivery and when their babies were eight months old.  THE
PSYCHOLOGISTS EXPECTED TO FIND HIGH LEVELS OF STRESS AND DEPRESSION
AMONG TWO DISTINCT GROUPS:  WOMEN WHO WENT AGAINST THEIR PREFERENCES
EITHER BY RETURNING TO WORK OR BY STAYING HOME.

2nd column	1st paragraph
WHAT THEY FOUND, HOWEVER, WAS THAT THE WOMEN WHO PREFERRED TO BE
WORKING BUT CHOSE TO STAY HOME REPORTED MORE SYMPTOMS OF STRESS AND
DEPRESSION- APPARENTLY AS A RESULT OF CONFLICT AND CONFUSION ABOUT
THEIR ROLES.

2nd paragraph
THE RESEARCHERS THEORIZE THAT THEIR SURPRISING FINDINGS MIGHT BE
EXPLAINED BY THE FACT THAT THE WORKING MOTHERS "RECEIVED PERSONAL
VALIDATION" BY THEIR ABILITY TO CONTRIBUTE FINANCIALLY TO THE FAMILY'S
NEEDS.  THEY DIDN'T EXPERIENCE CONFLICTS ABOUT THEIR ROLES AS MOTHER
AND BREADWINNER BECAUSE THEY WERE MAKING MEASURABLE CONTRIBUTIONS TO
THE FAMILY IN BOTH ROLES.  In contrast, women who wanted to work but
didn't felt psychological distress when they stayed home.

SHOPPING FOR A LITTLE EDUCATION

1st column	1st paragraph
For your preschooler, shopping can be wonderfully exhilarating and
educational.  "It may be commonplace to us, but making purchases can
feel brand-new to a young child," says Barbara Willer, PhD, Public
Affairs Director of the National Association for the Education of
Young Children.  "IF YOU FOCUS ON WAYS TO MAKE SHOPPING FUN FOR BOTH
YOU AND YOUR CHILD, YOU CAN RECAPTURE SOME OF THE WONDER."

4th paragraph
INTRODUCE YOUR YOUNGSTER TO THE IDEA OF SHOPPING AS AN EXCHANGE BY
ASKING HER TO HAND THE MONEY TO A CASHIER.  "Money can be an abstract
concept for preschoolers.  For example, it doesn't make sense to them
that pennies are larger but dimes are worth more," says Willer.  "They
can, however, begin to understand the idea that shopping is a
transaction."

2nd column	1st paragraph
CALL YOUR CHILD'S ATTENTION TO WAYS ITEMS CAN BE CLASSIFIED AND
COMPARED.  "How are these two shirts alike?"  Or, "These gloves cost
$7, and these cost $10.  Which costs more?"

2nd paragraph
A young child can scribble her own list, and once you're in the store,
she can check items off the list as you purchase them.  IN THIS WAY,
YOUR CHILD LEARNS THE IMPORTANCE OF THE WRITTEN WORD AS SHE LINKS THE
"WORDS" ON HER LIST WITH ACTUAL ITEMS IN THE STORE.

"And the sweet little hen watched as the big, strong rooster saved all

been eradicated from books fro preschoolers- right?  Not yet, says
Scott McDonald in a recent article in the Journal of Genetic
Psychology in which he reviewed picture books published between 1976
and 1987.  IN SOME BOOKS INTENDED FOR PRESCHOOLERS AND KINDERGARTNERS,
THE CENTRAL CHARACTERS WERE TWICE AS LIKELY TO BE MALE AS FEMALE.  And
the roles for male and female characters were overwhelmingly
traditional- females continue to be princesses, teachers and
housewives, or wicked witches and step-mothers, while males occupy a
wider variety of roles- from adventurers to rulers to woodcutters.
