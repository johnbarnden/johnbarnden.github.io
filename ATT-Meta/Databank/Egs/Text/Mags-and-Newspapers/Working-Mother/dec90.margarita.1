FOR INSTANCE, THE COMPUTER-DESIGNED BODY STRUCTURE IS BUILT TO BE
INCREDIBLY RIGID, GIVING YOU THE SECURE FEELING AND QUIET RIDE OF A
MUCH LARGER CAR.

3rd paragraph
In fact, the Mazda Protege actually has more roomfront and rear- than
a Mercedes Benz 190E.

4th paragraph
ALL OF WHICH MAY NOT BE SO SURPRISING WHEN YOU CONSIDER HOW THE
PROTEGE CASTS A SILHOUETTE THAT'S STRIKINGLY SIMILAR TO THOSE OF
BIGGER EUROPEAN FAMILY SEDANS.

5th paragraph
However, the real fun doesn't start until the engine does.  You see,
under the hood beats the heart of a true sports sedan.  Indeed, the
5-speed, 125-horsepower Protege can zip from 0- 60 faster than a BMW
318is.

6th paragraph
WE COULD TELL YOU MORE, BUT FACT AND FIGURES ARE NO SUBSTITUTE FOR
FEELINGS.  Instead, we recommend a visit to your Mazda Dealer.

7th paragraph
Because whether you look at it, sit in it or step on it, the Mazda
Protege is the compact car for people who have had enough of less.

Title:  Political Action, Holiday Peace
By:  Judsen Culbreth

1st column	1st paragraph
MANY OF YOU HAD A STRONG RESPONSE TO OUR SEPTEMBER ARTICLE "WHERE IN
THE WORLD IS CHILD CARE BETTER?"  A mother of two in Hilton, New York,
wrote, "I feel as if I have just had a glass of water thrown in my
face!  I AM ASTOUNDED.  I WAS COMPLETELY BLIND TO WHAT OTHER
INDUSTRIALIZED COUNTRIES ARE DOING FOR THEIR FAMILIES.  The next
letter I write is to my Congressman."  FROM BANDERA, TEXAS, A MOTHER
WITH TWO YOUNG SONS COMMENTED:  IT MAKES ME ANGRY THAT OUR GOVERNMENT
CAN'T (WILL NOT) FIND BETTER MEANS TO PROTECT OUR MOST IMPORTANT
RESOURCE, OUR CHILDREN."  A Gansevoort, New York, reader stated, "I
broke out in goose bumps!  Angry tears came to my eyes when I read
your article.  Children and moms are being so terribly shortchanged by
our 98-percent male Congress!"  AND THIS FROM A MT. WASHINGTON,
KENTUCKY, MOTHER:  "I NEVER THOUGHT I'D SEE THE DAY THAT I WOULD WISH
I LIVED SOMEWHERE OTHER THAN THE UNITED STATES, BUT SWEDEN IS
OBVIOUSLY THE PLACE TO BE FOR WORKING MOTHERS (AND FATHERS).  Fifteen
months of paid, job-protected maternity leave....I am green with
envy."

2nd paragraph
THE ANTIDOTE TO CHILD CARE ENVY IS ACTION.  As we go to press, the
House/Senate Conference considering the child care bill had not
reached an agreement, and the Family and Medical Leave Act, which
guarantees a job-protected maternity leave and which President Bush
vetoed last spring, has been reintroduced in the Senate.  Send
Postcards to Honorable Thomas S. Foley (U.S. House of Representatives,
Washington, DC 20515) and Honorable George Mitchell (U.S. Senate,
Washington, DC 20510)  urging them to support legislation for
affordable, quality care and to pass the Family Medical Leave Act.  If
America's 53.9 million working parents all spoke out on these
important issues, Congress would be forced to listen.

2nd column	1st paragraph
FROM THE POLITICAL FRONT TO THE HOME FRONT- HERE'S A TIP I'VE BEEN
TESTING MYSELF:  WHEN YOU WANT YOUR CHILD TO CHILL OUT, INSTEAD OF
RAISING YOUR VOICE AND YELLING, LOWER IT INSTEAD.  KEEPING COOL
YOURSELF INSTILLS A SENSE OF CALMNESS IN A CHILD.  I DISCOVERED THIS
HELPFUL INT, WHICH WORKS ON MY TWO A FAIR AMOUNT OF THE TIME, IN BETH
THAMES'S ARTICLE "CALM DOWN!"  During the Christmas and Hanukkah
season when even the most mild-mannered children can get overtired and
overtimulated, her peace-producing suggestions are a blessing.

1st column	1st paragraph
Talk about on-site child care!  THE PRODUCERS OF "LIVE WITH REGIS &
KATHIE LEE" WERE SO ANXIOUS TO WELCOME BACK CO-HOST KATHIE LEE GIFFORD
FROM MATERNITY LEAVE THAT THEY TRANSFORMED HER DRESSING ROOM INTO
NURSERY COMPLETE WITH CRIB AND LOVE SEAT.  "I KNOW IT'S A LUXURY A LOT
OF WORKING WOMEN DON'T HAVE," ADMITS GIFFORD, "BUT I'M VERY GRATEFUL."

2nd paragraph
Gifford returned to the show just five weeks after a cesarean
delivery.  SHE HAS A WEEKDAY, LIVE-IN NANNY WHO CARES FOR CODY ON AND
OFF THE SET, AND HER HUSBAND, SPORTS ANALYST FRANK GIFFORD, IS EAGER
TO HELP WHEN HE CAN.  Dad's favorite way to pitch in is to handle the
evening bath.  "I can always tell when Daddy has bathed Cody because
his sleeper is o backwards!"  laughs Gifford.

3rd paragraph
DESPITE LIVE-IN CHILD CARE, GIFFORD HAD DOUBTS ABOUT MANAGING HER BUSY
SCHEDULE, WHICH INCLUDES AN ONGOING CONCERT TOUR WITH CO-HOST REGIS
PHILBIN.  "I WONDERED HOW I WAS GOING TO GET BACK TO A FULL WORK
LOAD," SHE ADMITS, BECAUSE IN THE PAST I WOULD BE SO EXHAUSTED BY
FRIDAY THAT I WOULD COLLAPSE FOR THE ENTIRE WEEKEND."

4th paragraph to top of 2nd column
Now, says Gifford, the promise of spending uninterrupted weekends with
Cody, plus energy she gets from a new exercise routine, is more than
enough to keep her going.  "I THINK THAT PROBABLY A LOT OF WOMEN
NEGLECT THEMSELVES AFTER HAVING A BABY, BUT TELLING A NEW MOM TO
EXERCISE IS THE BEST ADVICE I COULD GIVE HER.  I've got more stamina
now than I ever had."

2nd column	2nd paragraph
Gifford often discusses wuch day-to-day details of her life on the
show, which opens with a freewheeling, 15-minute exchange between the
co-stars.  "Our show is built on the fact that Regis and I talk about
our personal lives, and Cody is the most important thing, next to my
husband, in my life.  So I try to share the funny things that happen.
BUT," SHE ADDS, "THAT MAY GET HARDER TO DO AS CODY GETS OLDER AND SAYS
'MOM, I DON'T WANT YOU SAYING THAT!"  Regis goes through that with his
teenage daughters- they've given him a total gag order!"

Title:  The Hidden Message Behind Gifts
Subheader:  WHAT YOUR MATE CHOOSES CAN REVEAL HOW HE REALLY FEELS
	ABOUT YOU
By:  Linda Lee Small

1st column	1st paragraph
It was Helene's 30th birthday, and her husband, Howard, excitedly led
her into the living room.  "You can open your eyes now," he said.
There in the middle of the floor were golf clubs, unwrapped but tied
with a big satin bow.  All Helene could say was, "Are those for me?"
Howard beamed, but Helene steamed.  A LONGTIME TENNIS PLAYER, SHE HAD
ABSOLUTELY NO INTEREST IN GOLF AND WAS DEFINITELY "TEED OFF."

2nd paragraph
MARYANNE WAS ALSO PRETTY MAD ABOUT HER HUSBAND'S GIFT.  It was an
exercise bike.  She had recently given birth to her second child and
was feeling out of shape.  OBVIOUSLY HER HUSBAND, JIM, FELT THE SAME
WAY ABOUT HER, WAS MARYANNE'S THOUGHT WHEN SHE SAW HER GIFT FOR THEIR
10TH ANNIVERSARY.  She instantly burst into tears.  Every time she
looked at that bike she could "hear" Jim telling her that she needed
to lose weight.

2nd column	1st paragraph
Gifts between spouses deliver potent messages.  "EVERY PRESENT HAS AN
ELEMENT OF THE UNCONSCIOUS IN IT," SAYS LINDA BARBANEL, MSW, A NEW
YORK CITY PSYCHOTHERAPIST.  "IT COULD SAY 'I LOVE YOU,' OR I WANT YOU
TO LOVE ME,' BUT IT COULD ALSO ANNOUNCE 'HERE'S WHAT I REALLY THINK
ABOUT YOU.'  A good gift should say I'm paying attention- I hear
you,'" explains Barbanel.  "IT SHOULD DEMONSTRATE THAT THE GIVER HAS
THOUGHT ABOUT THE RECEIVER."  HOWARD'S AND JIM'S GIFTS BOTH SPOKE
ABOUT THEIR OWN DESIRES.

3rd column	1st paragraph
But the fact is there are often two different interpretations
surrounding one gift:  the message intended by the giver and the one
interpreted by the receiver.  IF WE COULD READ HOWARD'S M IND, HE WAS
PROBABLY THINKING, "I'LL BUY THESE GOLF CLUBS SO HELENE AND I CAN
SPEND MORE TIME TOGETHER."  BUT HELENE'S RESPONSE WAS, "THAT PRESENT
IS FOR HIM- NOT ME."

pg. 16		1st column	1st paragraph
Gerald Piaget, PhD, a member of the clinical faculty of the Department
of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Stanford University Medical
Center, explains how some gift-givers get in trouble:  MOST OF US HAVE
GROWN UP HEARING 'DO UNTO OTHERS AS YOU WOULD HAVE OTHERS DO UNTO
YOU,' BUT THE GOLDEN RULE OF GIFT-GIVING SHOULD BE 'DO UNTO OTHERS AS
OTHERS WOULD HAVE YOU DO UNTO THEM.'"  (IF JIM HAD FOLLOWED THAT
GUIDELINE, HE WOULD HAVE ASKED HIMSELF, "I WONDER IF MARYANNE WOULD
LIKE AN EXERCISE BIKE?")

Subheader:
THE GHOST OF PRESENTS PAST

2nd paragraph
But perhaps there is a more subtle rule to good gift-giving:  "Do unto
others as they are accustomed to being done unto by their families."
WE ALL CARRY INTO OUR MARRIAGES MEMORIES OF HOW OUR FAMILIES
CELEBRATED OCCASIONS, SO IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND YOUR MATE'S
FAMILY HISTORY BEFORE YOU GO OUT SHOPPING.  Take birthdays.  One
family my trot out party favors, balloons and a big cake with candles,
while in another household the day slips by practically unnoticed.
AND WE ALL ARRIVE AT HANUKKAH OR CHRISTMAS WITH MEMORIES INFORMING OUR
EXPECTATIONS.  SO IF YOUR FAMILY TENDED TO "GO FOR BROKE" WITH
EXTRAVAGANT PRESENTS WHILE YOUR MATE COMES FROM THE SCROOGE SCHOOL OF
GIFT-GIVING, THE TWO OF YOU WILL HAVE VERY DIFFERENT FEELINGS ABOUT
WHAT'S APPROPRIATE.

3rd paragraph
ANOTHER ASPECT OF FAMILY TRADITION DICTATES HOW INVOLVED THE RECEIVER
EXPECTS TO BE IN THE PROCESS.  Some mates come from families where the
practice is to all but buy your own gift:  Members drop hints, cut out
pictures of what they want and exchange lists before they exchange
presents.  IN OTHER FAMILIES IT IS CONSIDERED TACKY, INSULTING OR EVEN
GREEDY IF YOU SO MUCH AS DROP A CLUE.  There's no right or wrong way,
just different styles, stresses Michael Berger, PhD, director of the
Atlanta Institute for Family Studies in Georgia.  "But you have to
recognize the need to accommodate your partner," Berger says.
"Gift-giving is just one of the myriad ways our mate differs from us.
But we can still love each other."  And give each other appropriate
gifts.

4th paragraph to top of 2nd column
Take Rhonda and Bob.  Rhonda, a fundraiser from Atlanta, comes from a
small family that always made a big deal over birthdays and holidays,
and she continues that tradition in her own home.  SHE LOVES THE
PROCESS:  "I GET REAL PLEASURE FROM ALL THAT GOES INTO IT- PLANNING
THE GIFT, BUYING IT, WRAPPING IT, HIDING IT.  And I get a good feeling
when my husband likes the gift."  Yet Rhonda hands Bob a list for him
to select her gift from.  IT'S NOT THAT SHE DOESN'T LIKE SURPRISES;
IT'S THAT BOB COMES FROM A LARGE FAMILLY IN WHICH ALL THE MEMBERS MADE
THEIR WISHES KNOWN AND TREATED GIFT-GIVING AS A CHORE.  BOB GETS VERY
NERVOUS IF HE HAS TO CHOOSE A PRESENT FOR RHONDA BY HIMSELF.  SHE
UNDERSTANDS, SO SHE HELPS HIM OUT.

Subheader:
A FOR EFFORT

2nd column	1st paragraph
CLEARLY, THE THOUGHT THAT GOES INTO THE PRESENT COUNTS.  For some
receivers the process plays a big part in the message.

2nd paragraph
MOST PEOPLE ARE PLEASED WHEN THEY ARE ON THE RECEIVING END OF A GIFT
THE GIVER KNEW THEY WANTED.  Barbara, an educator in Westport,
Connecticut, has shared over 37 Hanukkahs with her husband, Jules.
She warmly recalls one of their first:  "We were shopping for a winter
coat and I found one I loved, but it wasn't in my size.  Jules copied
the name of the manufacturer when I wasn't looking, tracked down the
coat in another city and presented it to me for the first night of
Hanukkah.  I've owned more expensive coats, but none has ever meant as
much.  I wore that coat for years and years."

3rd paragraph
LIKE BARBARA, MOST OF US APPRECIATE GIFTS THAT SAY "IT TOOK TIME AND
THOUGHT TO FIND ME."  THE GIFT NOT ONLY SENDS A LOVING MESSAGE, BUT
THERE IS SOME SATISFACTION IN KNOWING THAT THE MESSENGER (A.K.A. OUR
MATE) BATTLED FIGURATIVE HAIL AND SLEET, OR JUST LONG LINES AT THE
CHECKOUT COUNTER, TO CAPTURE IT.

4th paragraph
However, there's a message not only in the effort a gift required but
in the method by which it was given.  Sarah, an editor, showed her
husband, Steve, the new green leather pants she'd bought:  "He knew
that this was a real splurge for me.  I happened to mention that the
pants had a matching jacket, but I couldn't afford it right now."
SARAH ORGOT ALL ABOUT IT UNTIL A FEW DAYS LATER WHEN SHE OPENED HER
CLOSET AND THERE WAS THE JACKET HANGING OVER THE PANTS.  Steve really
hates shopping, so Sarah gives him high marks for not only tracking
down the jacket, but hiding it in her closet so she could stumble onto
it in surprise.

Subheader:
THE PERSONAL TOUCH

5th paragraph to top of 3rd column
Good gifts are rarely "one size fits all."  ACCORDING TO ROBERTA
BUMBERG, PHD, A THERAPIST IN NEW YORK CITY, "WE ENJOY GETTING PRESENTS
THAT REFLECT A RECOGNITION OF OUR STYLE, AND WHICH INDICATE THAT THE
PERSON CHOSE IT JUST FOR US."  Dr. Bumberg offers as an example the
husband who had a saddle designed for his equestrian wife.  WHETHER
IT'S RIDING HORSEBACK, READING MYSTERIES OR LISTENING TO THE OPERA,
YOUR INTEREST IS A KEY TO THE KIND OF PRESENT YOU'D LIKE.  A BAD
CHOICE MAKES YOU FEEL YOU OPENED UP A PRESENT THAT WAS MEANT FOR
SOMEONE ELSE.

3rd column	2nd paragraph
GOOD GIVERS ALSO RECOGNIZE THE MANY FACES, AND FACETS, OF THEIR MATES:
SERIOUS AND FRIVOLOUS, DOWN-TO-EARTH TODAY AND MAYBE A LITTLE WILD AND
ROMANTIC TOMORROW.  THAT WAS THE SPIRIT BEHIND THE PRESENTS WARD GAVE
RECENTLY TO HIS NEW WIFE, JULIE, A BOOKKEEPER.  He presented her with
an electric can opener because she had been complaining of chipping
her nail polish opening cans, but he also gave her a sapphire ring to
wear on one of her manicured fingers.

3rd paragraph
Some gifts almost universally signal love.  They are made by the
giver- photographs, paintings, knitted sweaters.  Lilly Gross, a
ballet dancer, truly treasures the first gift she received from her
husband Hank.  A dentist, he made her a tiny gold ballet-slipper charm
fashioned from 18-karat dentist's gold.  AS LILLY SAYS, "THE CHARM WAS
EXQUISITE, BUT THE REAL PLEASURE I GOT FROM THE JEWLERY WAS IN KNOWING
HE MADE IT ESPECIALLY FOR ME."

Subheader:
PRACTICAL...OR INSULTING?

5th paragraph
Really practical gifts can be great- or gross.  The worst ones are
things you would probably get anyway and that should be household
expenses.  Say it's your birthday and the toaster is regularly buring
your whole wheat:  If your husband gives you a new toaster it's the
equivalent of killing two birds with one stone- he's knocking off your
birthday plus an item on the family's most-needed list.  Many givers
seem to justify their choices by pointing out that the gift is useful.
BUT IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE SAYING, "OH GOODY, JUST WHAT I ALWAYS WANTED-
A VACUUM CLEANER."

pg. 18		1st column	1st paragraph
OTHER PRACTICAL GIFTS IMPLY SAY "YOU SHOULD KNOW YOUR PLACE."  These
might as well be wrapped in pink for her (frying pans, irons) and blue
for him (lawn mowers, power tools).

2nd paragraph
"A GIFT SHOULD MAKE YOU FEEL SPECIAL," OBSERVES DR. BERGER, "AND SOME
PRACTICAL GIFTS JUST DON'T MAKE YOU FEEL THAT WAY."  REMEMBER, WHAT'S
IMPORTANT IS THE MEANING YOU ATTACH TO THE GIFT.  If your husband
gives you a coffee grinder, it doesn't really matter if it's
practical.  WHAT COUNTS IS IF YOU LOVE THE IDEA OF HAVING FRESHLY
GROUND COFFEE," SAYS BERGER.  (By the same token, Julie loved her
electric can opener because her husband knew it would spare her
beautiful nails.)

3rd paragraph
IN LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIPS THERE IS OFTEN A KIND OF GIFT-GIVING
BURNOUT, AND IT CAN CAUSE COUPLES TO LEAN TOWARD THE PRACTICAL.
THAT'S WHT LED VIVIAN, A DISTRICT ATTORNEY IN NEW YORK CITY, TO BUY
HER HUSBAND, SID, AN AUTOMATIC COFFEE MAKER FOR THEIR 11TH
ANNIVERSARY.  SHE LIKED THE FACT THAT IT COULD TURN ITSELF ON SUNDAY
MORNINGS WHILE THEY WERE IN BED READING THE PAPERS.  Sid opened the
present and laughed- he had bought Vivian the same coffee pot.  THE
MESSAGE WAS CLEAR:  WE TRULY DO KNOW EACH OTHER.  (The only problem
was which pot to return.)

Subheader:
REALLY ROTTEN PRESENTS

4th paragraph
Some gifts are designed not to please the receiver but to control him
or her.  THE MESSAGE CAN BE HIDDEN, SO THE RECIPIENT HAS TO READ
CAREFULLY BETWEEN THE WRAPPINGS AND BOWS.  Albert Angrilli, PhD, a
family therapist in Hartsdale, New York, recalls the homebody husband
who gave hi wife, who loved to travel, an adorable puppy for
Christmas.  The first weekend in January, when the wife suggested they
go away, her husband innocently answered, "Oh, I'd love to, but how
can we leave the puppy?"  IT TOOK AWHILE, BUT SHE FINALLY SAW THROUGH
THE "THOUGHT" BEHIND HER HUSBAND'S SELECTION.

5th paragraph
IF A GOOD GIFT SAYS "THANK YOU FOR BEING YOU," A BAD ONE PRACTICALLY
SINGS OUT "I DON'T LOVE YOU JUST THE WAY YOU ARE."  ACCORDING TO DR.
BERGER, "THESE GIFTS ARE OFTEN PERCEIVED AS SAYING 'WITH MY HELP YOU
CAN IMPROVE.'"

6th paragraph to top of 2nd column
IT WAS OVER 10 YEARS AGO, BUT BERT STILL REMEMBERS THE GIFT
CERTIFICATE HIS WIFE GAVE HIM FOR A HAIRSTYLING AT AN EXPENSIVE SALON.
THE PROBLEM WAS THAT BERT WAS PERFECTLY HAPPY WITH HIS OLD STYLE, AND
HE NEVER USED THE CERTIFICATE.

2nd column	1st paragraph
SUCH GIFTS ARE DESIGNED TO TURN THE RECEIVER INTO WHAT THE GIVER WANTS
HIM TO BE.  Thus, a husband might give his wife cooking lessons
knowing she htes to cook, or a wife might give her overweight mate a
year's membership in a gym.  GIFTS LIKE THESE MAY BE GIVEN TO BE
HELPFUL, BUT THEY ARE OFTEN SEEN AS PUT-DOWNS.  (Remember Jim?  HIS
GIFT OF AN EXERCISE BIKE WAS A MESSAGE TO HIS WIFE TO SHAPE UP AND
THIN DOWN INTO HIS IDEA OF A DREAM MATE.)

2nd paragraph
X-rated lingerie can also be a good example of a bad gift.  "It's
rather typical, though," says Dr. Angrilli.  HE TELLS THE STORY OF A
PROFESSIONAL WOMAN WHO CONSIDERED HERSELF TO BE A HEALTHY, SEXY
FEMALE.  But her husband insisted on buying her see-through nightgowns
and provocative underwear, which she refused to wear.  HIS GIFTS WERE
SUPPOSED TO TRANSFORM HER INTO HIS NOTION OF A SEDUCTIVE WOMAN.  TO
HER, THEY MEANT THAT HER WAY OF BEING SEXY WASN'T ENOUGH.

3rd paragraph
SOME GIFTS ARE SO OBVIOUSLY BAD-INTENTIONED THAT THE MESSAGE IS HARDLY
HIDDEN AT ALL.  AS PSYCHOTHERAPIST LINDA BARBANEL POINTS OUT, "GIFTS
CAN CONVEY:  `I'M MAD AS HELL AT YOU.'  THAT'S TOUGH TO SAY OUT LOUD,
SO THE MESSAGE IS DELIVERED INSTEAD THROUGH A HOSTILE GIFT."

Subheader:
THE PRICE IS RIGHT- THERE

5th paragraph
It's hard to "ooh" or "ah" over a present that's worth five dollars
max.  (The recipient of a plastic hairclip grumbled, "I think he just
picked it up on the steet from a peddler.")  DR. PIAGET NOTES THAT
"SOME GIFTS SAY `I DON'T THINK YOU'RE WORTH A LOT.'  They're so cheap
that they're like leaving a one-cent tip for a waitress."

3rd column	1st paragraph
One of the negative messages of money selecting money is that no
effort went into it.  HOW MUCH THOUGHT DOES IT TAKE TO PICK OUT JUST
THE "RIGHT" BILL?

Subheader:
STRAIGHT TO THE HEART

2nd paragraph
Some of the best gifts of all are those that arise out of genuine
feelings and celebrate no particular occasion- almost like Cupid, the
gift-giver aims  straight for the heart.  They can be small tokens-
like the sea-shells Irv, an interior designer, paints for Fran and
leaves on her desk.  (One shell read:  "I'm gld we have each other.")
SUCH GIFTS OFTEN SPEAK IN THE UNIQUE LANGUAGE OF THE LOVERS AND CAN BE
UNDERSTOOD ONLY BY THEM.  Julie, the bookkeeper, recently packed cans
of Green Giant baby corn in a Tiffany box for Ward, who's a chef.  As
Julie explains the present:  "Ward would never use anything but fresh
vegetables in his restaurant, but at home he enjoys the crunch he gets
from that brand."  Obviously, Ward could buy his own canned corn, but
the beautifully wrapped gift procalimed, "I'm thinking of you and what
you really like."

3rd paragraph
And then there are the couples who don't exchange gifts on traditional
occasions.  Married to Martin for 22 years, Angela has yet to receive
a birthday or anniversary gift from him.  As she explains, "MARTIN HAS
NEVER BELIEVED IN RIGIDLY OBSERVING CERTAIN DAYS.  When I complained,
years and years ago, he said, `It's more important what I do the other
364 days.'"  So Martin celebrates "unbirthdays," "rainy days" and even
"Happy Tuesdays."  Angela may get flowers today or white chocolate
tomorrow.  Recently she found a little box on her home computer.
Inside was a gold heart ring she admired in a neighborhood
jewlery-store window.  THE ATTACHED NOTE READ:  "I KNOW YOUR HEART WAS
SET ON THIS."

DINNER MUSIC

1st column	2nd paragraph
Her findings:  Those who heard the rock `n' roll ate one and a half
times as much as those who listened to slow music or no music.  Why?
Because they at twice as fast (probably lifting their fork in time
with the beat).  A FEELING OF FULLNESS DOESN'T REGISSTER UNTIL 20 TO
25 MINUTES AFTER FOOD IS CONSUMED, SO QUICK DINNERS DON'T REALIZE
THEY'VE HAD ENOUGH UNTIL THEY'VE OVERDONE IT.

cause for concern for women under age 55 if the relative developed

Subheader:  HOW TO SAVE MONEY FOR THE KIDS AND REDUCE TAXES AT THE
	SAME TIME
By:  Deborah Rankin

1st column	1st paragraph
WITH ALL THE RUSH AND BUSTLE OF PREPARING FOR THE HOLIDAYS, IT'S EASY
TO FORGET THAT TAX SEASON IS NOT FAR OFF.  A reminder, then:  The
holidays mark the close of one tax year and the beginning of another-
and it is never too late, or too early, to think about minimizing the
annual tax bite on your family's income.

3rd paragraph
AS YOU KNOW, EACH YEAR, YOU AND YOUR HUSBAND MUST PAY TAX (15, 28, OR
33 PERCENT, DEPENDING ON YOUR TAX BRACKET) ON ANY INCOME, SUCH AS
INTEREST, DIVIDENDS, PROFITS FROM SALE, THAT YOUR INVESTMENTS PRODUCE.
YOU MAY NOT KNOW, HOWEVER, THAT YOU CAN REDUCE THE TAX ON THIS INCOME
BY GIVING A PORTION OF THESE ASSETS TO YOUR CHILDREN- WHO, SO LONG AS
CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS ARE OBSERVED, WILL BE TAXED AT A RATE LOWER THAN
YOUR OWN.

5th paragraph
Before choosing to exercise this option, however, you should be aware
that it does entail some risk, because once these gifts are made, they
are irrevocable- meaning that you can't take them back should you find
yourself in a financial pinch.  Furthermore, although your children
can't touch this money while they are minors, once they reach the age
of majority (which should be 18 or 21, as set by your state), all
decisions on how to spend this money are made by them.  "THIS MEANS,"
SAYS KESS, "THAT THEY CAN DO ANYTHING THEY WANT TO WITH THE MONEY.  IF
SANDY BEACHES ARE MORE ENTICING TO THEM THAN IVY COVERED WALLS- THAT'S
THE CHANCE YOU TAKE."

6th paragraph to top of 2nd column
IF YOU'D RATHER NOT TAKE THIS CHANCE, YOU MIGHT CONSIDER TWO OTHER
OPTIONS.  THE FIRST POSSIBILITY IS TO PURCHASE THE NEW "QUALIFIED"
SERIES EE U.S. SAVINGS BONDS.  THESE BONDS CAN BE REDEEMED TOTALLY
TAX-FREE IF THE PROCEEDS ARE USED TO PAY COLLEGE TUITION.  Because the
bonds have to be in your name, not your child's, you can cash them in
at any time and use the money for other purposes if you need to.  (But
in that case you'll have to pay taxes on the interest earned.)  Sounds
perfect right?  But there's a big drawback:  The tax exemption starts
to phase out for the couples with adjusted gross income of $60,000 and
singles with income of $40,000.

SETTING UP A CUSTODIAL ACCOUNT

pg. 32		1st column	5th paragraph to top of 2nd column
You can name yourself as custodian, but it's wiser not to.  THE
REASON:  IF A PARENT SERVES AS BOTH "DONOR" (THE PERSON WHO OPENS AND
MAKES DEPOSITS INTO THE ACCOUNT) AND "CUSTODIAN" (THE PERSON WHO
MANAGES IT), THE ACCOUNT WILL BE CONSIDERED PART OF THAT PARENT'S
ESTATE SHOULD HE OR SHE DIE BEFORE THE CHILD COMES OF AGE.  The result
is that a piece of the estate could be eaten up by federal estate
taxes which might have been avoided had another adult been named
custodian.  If yours is a two-parent household, then, it's best if one
parent acts as "donor" and the other as "custodian."  If you head a
one-parent household, it's wise to name a trusted friend or relative
as custodian.

DO WHAT FEELS RIGHT

3rd column	2nd paragraph
ONLY YOU AND YOUR HUSBAND CAN DECIDE WHICH OF THESE TAX-SAVING
STRATEGIES SUIT YOUR FAMILY.  MAKING THIS DECISION WISELY REQUIRES AN
INVESTMENT OF TIME, ENERGY AND THOUGHT.  You will also have to put in
a few extra hours at tax time filing out seperate returns for your
children.
