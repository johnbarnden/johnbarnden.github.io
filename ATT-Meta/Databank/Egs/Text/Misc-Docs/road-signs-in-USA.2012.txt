On I-40 interstate freeway in Oklahoma, USA, August 2012

Noticed by John Barnden 



(1) Road sign saying:

       TASTY EXIT AHEAD
 
    because of a particular restaurant being available off the exit.

    NB: The name of the restuarant *may* have had the word "tasty" in
    it.


(2) Road sign saying:

       COZY EXIT AHEAD
 
    because of a Hampton Inn being available off the exit.

    NB: Advertisements for Hampton Inns make a special feature of the
    cosiness of the inns. ["Cozy" is US equivalent of British "cosy".]
