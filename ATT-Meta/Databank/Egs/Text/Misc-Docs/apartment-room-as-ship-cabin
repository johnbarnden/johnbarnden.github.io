From article: "Tiny London Apartment on Sale for $335K"

Quote:

   "It's about the size of a ship's galley," said Andrew Scott, the
   director of Lane Fox, the agency handling the sale. "But it's (*
   permanently anchored *) to one of the wealthiest neighborhoods in the
   world."

Later: 

   "If you thought of this as (* the cabin on a boat,*) (* you'd say, 'It's
   pretty spacious,'*) " Scott said.
