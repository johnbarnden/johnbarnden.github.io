'War and Peace' - Tolstoy
=========================
(publisher not recorded, but in Hertfordshire) 1993

p.119: 

His [Bilbin's] conversation was always sprinkled with wittily original,
finished phrases of general interest.  These sayings were prepared in
the inner laboratory of his mind in a portable form as if intentionally,
so that insignificant society people might carry them from drawing-room
to drawing-room.
