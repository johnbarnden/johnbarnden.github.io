"The Business", novel by Iain Banks
===================================
London: Little, Brown, 1999. 


p.298: During one of the wilder bits of the flight, I found myself touching and
stroking the little flower in my lapel.  My hand was on the brink of jerking
away again (* AS MY BRAIN THOUGHT, *) Hello, is this some sort of rosary scene
going on here?  I looked down at my hand as though it belonged to somebody else.
Then I thought, No, this is just a childish thing.  Comfort, not superstition.

p.299: Contemplating myself in the generously sized and perfectly lit mirror
above the deep marble basin,(* MY AVARICIOUS SIDE *) - stunned into shocked
silence, like most of the rest of me, by the traumatic transition from Thuhn to
Siliguri - (* WOKE UP BRIEFLY TO LOOK ROUND THE PLANE *) and say, I want one!
(* WHILE A SIDE I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW I HAD REARED ITS CURIOUS HEAD AND WITH A
SHAKE OF IT SAID, HOW SICKENINGLY OSTENTATIOUS AND WASTEFUL.  BUT THEN BOTH
THESE DISPUTING DEMISPHERES FELL PROMPTLY ASLEEP *) as soon as I settled my
occasionally fondled but assuredly never abused butt into my seat.
