p.13:
We think increasingly by means of metaphors that we profess [ital]_not_ to be
relying on.  The metaphors we are avoiding steer our thought as much as those
we accept. (Richards, 1936, 92.)


p.90:
Metaphor is the linguistic realization of a leap of thought from one domain to
another---in which the springboard is a structure-preserving mapping.


p.119:
These unconscious activities underlie our conscious thoughts, and the latter
are but a taming, censoring, and making reasonable [of] the well-springs of
mental activity. {In a discussion of Freud.]


p.204:
It is the apprehension of these two, not easily reconciled, concepts, held
together in the metaphor and consequently held together in the mind, that I
want to evike when I speak of the double semantic relation ... of metaphors.

p.284: pregnant with ideas {in a discussion of Socrates as midwife}
