p.132:

[S]he had curves, soft round ones, made her look older than sixteen.
Lovely, Selena was; the kind of lovely that couldn't last. You could see
that somewhere this summer, maybe even this afternoon, this was the
loveliest she'd ever be.
[NP]
You don't want to notice this stuff on a kid, your mind wants to jump
away. But it matters, same as it would on a grown woman. Changes every
day of her life. So you notice. Scrape the greasy feeling off your mind
whatever way you can. [EP]



p.142:

[NP] [The teenage schoolgirls] [s]louched and fidgeted in their chairs,
batted looks, eyebrow-lifts, whispers back and forth. They thought we
[the detectives] were done with them, had dumped us out of their
minds. Some of them, anyway. [EP]


p.149:

[Teenage schoolgirl] Selena thinks about that [a question she's just
been asked about why she wants to escape again at night from the
boarding school they are at.] She hears all the voices from when she was
little, soothing, strengthening. _Don't be scared, not of monsters, not
of witches, not of big dogs._ And now, snapping loud from every
direction: _Be scared, you have to be scared,_ ordering like this is
your one absolute duty. Be scared you're fat, ... Be scared to walk on
your own, ... Be scared of wearing the wrong stuff, saying the wrong
thing, ... Be scared of strangers. ... Be scared you won't do well
enough in your examinations, ... Be scared terrified petrified that
everything you are is every kind of wrong. Good girl.
[NP]
At the same time, in a cool untouched part of her mind, she sees the
moon. She feels the shimmer of what it might look like in their own
private midnight.(*)
[NP]
She says, `We're different now. That was the whole point. So we need to
be doing something different. Otherwise ... [dots in original]'
[NP]
She doesn't know how to say what she sees. That moment in the glade
sliding away, blurring. Them [she and her frineds] dulling slowly back
to normal.

[(*) These sentences allude to an occasion when Selena and her friends at
her boarding school escaped late at night and spent time in a moonlit glade
in a nearby wood.]


p.216:

[NP] I [a detective] started [the search] on the bedside
lockers. Something about the Julia interview was poking at me. It was
stuck in a back corner of my mind, where I couldn't get my hands on it:
something she'd said, that we'd let go when we should have pounced. [EP]


p.322:

[NP] |The long day had my mind moving like porridge, bits of thought
taking forever to find each other. The corrdidor stretching away in
front of us looked unreal, tiles too red, lines too long, something we'd
never be able to stop seeing. [EP]


p.380:

[Julia] spent the weekend banging her head against what to do about
Chris and Selena. Her main instinct is to grab hold of Selena, probably
literally, and ask her what the fuck she thinks she's doing; but some
other instinct, further back and twisting restlessly, tells her that the
moment she says this out loud -- to Selena, or to Holly or Becca --
nothing will never be the same again. She can smell the poison smoke as
everything they've got roars into flame.
