[start of chapter 23:]
Tim. Tim Breary, standing in front of me.

This isn't an emotional response I'm having, it's an assault: so many
sensations screaming in the air that don't feel like mine. I don't
recognise their harshness, can't get a firm hold on any one of them. All
I can do is stand here as they whirl round me in a thick storm, cutting
me off from my surroundings. I'm closer to Tim and further away from
myself than I've been for a long time.
