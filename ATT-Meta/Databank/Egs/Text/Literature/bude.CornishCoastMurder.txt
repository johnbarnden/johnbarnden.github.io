From: "The Cornish Coast Murder" by John Bude
=============================================
London: The British Library, 2014


{unless otherwise obvious, the "he" is the Reverend Dodd, a vicar, who
is an amateur detective}


p.30:

[NP] He was experiencing a peculiarly mixed set of emotions. Horror and
dismay at the tragedy which had come so swiftly out of the night and put
an end to Julius Tregarthan's life. A compassionate pity for the girl
who had been so unexpectedly bereaved. But beyond these perfectly
natural reactions he was fired with an ardent glow of curiosity and
interest. One side of him warred with the other. He felt that it was
abhorrent to look upon crime, especially murder, as anything more than
foul and unthinkable. At the same time this little devil of curiosity
kept on tugging at his sleeve demanding attention.  ... It [the curiosity
etc.]  was wrong of him, of course, sinful even, but that little devil
was stronger than his conscience. ... It was [the police's] job to
apprehend criminals. It was his job to instil his fellow-men with a
brotherly love which would make criminals impossible. The argument was
good. But the little imp of curiosity was better. [EP]


p.110:

[NP] He returned with a sigh to his sermon. For twenty minutes, blessed
with great fluency, he wrote at breakneck speed and then, once again,
his inspiration dried up and the facts of Tregarthan's murder began to
revolve like a flock of blackbirds about his head. [NP] ... For a long
time the Vicar stared at the half-completed sheet of writing before him
then, unable to stomach his aridity of thought any longer, [he went out
for a walk].


p.152:

[NP] How, then, to explain the single shot? The Inspector couldn't. He
gave up the attempt. It was left to float like an irritating speck in the
back of his mind.[EP]
