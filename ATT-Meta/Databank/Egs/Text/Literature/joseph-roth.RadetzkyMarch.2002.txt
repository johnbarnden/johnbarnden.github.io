[start of ch14]
[NP]
The day the Lieutenant had to return to his garrison was a sad day
... . He walked back through the streets where the procession had passed
a couple of days before. In those days, thought the Lieutenant (in those
days, he thought), he had briefly been proud of himself and his
career. But today the thought of his return walked along at his side
like a guard escorting a prisoner. For the first time, Lieutenant Trotta
fonud himself rebelling against the army rules that had governed his
life. He had obeyed every since he'd been a small boy. Now he didn't
want to obey any more. ...
[same para]
Could he even afford freedom [if he left the army]? Had his grandfather,
the hero of Solferino, left a fortune? Would he ever inherit it from his
father? Never previously had he had such thoughts. Now they flocked to
him like a crowd of strange birds, built themselves nests in his brain,
and there fluttered about restlessly. Now he heard all the [p.220:]
bewildering clamour of the big wide world.
