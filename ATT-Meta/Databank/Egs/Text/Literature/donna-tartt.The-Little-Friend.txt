Donna Tartt: "The Little Friend"
================================
London: Bloomsbury, 2002


p.530: [NP] After a long while the nurse lumbered in again ... to give
Harriet a [p.531] shot. Harriet, who was rolling her head around, and
talking to herself a bit, struggled to pull away from her worries. With
effort, she turned her attention to the nurse.

p.544: [NP] Their talk turned to other things as Harriet--seized by
fear--lay with her face pressed in the pillow, very still. Never had it
occurred to her that she might be wrong in her suspicions about Danny
Ratliff--simply wrong. What if he hadn't killed Robin at all? [NP] She
had not bargained for the black horror that fell over her at this
thought, as if of a trap clicking shut behind her, and immediately she
tried to push the thought from her mind. ... She knew what he'd done,
even if nobody else did. [NP] But all the same, doubt had come down on
her suddenly and with great force, and with it the fear that she'd
stumbled blindly into something terrible. ... [NP] ... At one time, she
was very sure; ... But--like the foul taste in her mouth--a queasy fear
now lingered close, and would not leave her. Why had she been so sure?

p.547: Harriet tried to force her uneasiness out of her mind.

p.549: [NP] Harriet ate, diligently, with her eyes down, but her mind
raced back and forth like an animal in a cage, and suddenly a thought so
horrible leapt afresh to her mind that she blurted, aloud: "Is he sick?"
