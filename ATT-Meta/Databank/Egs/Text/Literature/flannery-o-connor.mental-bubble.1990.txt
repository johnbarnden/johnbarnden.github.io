 "My son just finished college last year. He wants to write but he's
  selling typewriters until he gets started," his [Julian's] mother said.

 The woman [across the aisle] leaned forward and peered at Julian. He
 threw her such a malevolent look that she subsided against the seat. On
 the floor across the aisle there was an abandoned newspaper. He got up
 and got it and opened it out in front of him. His mother discreetly
 continued the conversation in a lower tone but the woman across the
 aisle said in a loud voice, "Well, that's nice. Selling typewriters is
 close to writing. He can go right from one to the other."

 "I tell him," his mother said, "that Rome wasn't built in a day."

 Behind the newspaper Julian was withdrawing into the inner compartment
 of his mind where he spent most of his time. This was a kind of mental
 bubble in which he established himself when he could not bear to be
 a part of what was going on around him. From it he could see out and
 judge but in it he was safe from any kind of penetration from
 without. It was the only place where he felt free of the general idiocy
 of his fellows. His mother had never entered it but from it he could
 see her with absolute clarity.
[NP]
 The old lady [his mother] was clever enough and he thought that if she
 had started from any of the right premises, more might have been
 expected of her. She lived according to the laws of her own fantasy
 world, outside of which he had never seen her set foot.
