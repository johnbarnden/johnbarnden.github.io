John Williams: "Butcher's Crossing"
==================================
London: Vintage Books, 2014

{involves travel on US landscape by horse and ox-drawn wagon}


p.86/87: 

[p.86:]
The great plain swayed beneath them as they went steadily westward.

In the evening after the sun had gone down, the grass took on a purplish
hue as if it absorbed all the light from the sky and would not give it
back.

[p.86:] <P> After their first day's journey, the country lost some of
its flatness; it rolled out gently before them, and they traveled from
soft hollow to soft rise, as if they were tiny chips blown upon the
frozen surface of a great sea. 
<P> 
Upon the surface of this sea, among the slow hollows and crests, Will
Andrews found himself less and less conscious of any movement
forward. During the first few days of the journey he had been so torn
with the raw agony of movement that each forward step his mount took cut
itself upon his nerves and upon his mind. But the pain dulled after the
[p.87:] first days, and a kind of numbness took its place; he felt no
sensation of his buttocks upon the saddle, ... The horse beneath took
him from hollow to crest, yet it seemed to him that the land rather than
the horse moved beneath him like a great treadmill, revealing in its
movement only another part of itself.
<P>
Day by day the numbness crept upon him until at last the numbness seemed
to be himself. He felt himself to be like the land, without identity or
shape; sometimes one of the men would look at him, look through him, as if
he did not exist; and he had to shake his head sharply and move an arm
or a leg and glance at it to assure himself that he was visible.

p.96: The reality of their journey lay in the routine detail of bedding
down at night, arising in the morning, ... It seemed to him that he
moved forward laboriously, inch by inch, over the space of the vast
prairie; but it seemed that he did not move through time at all, that
rather time moved with him, an invisible cloud that hovered about him
and clung to him as he went forward.


p.180:

<P> The days slid one into another, marked by evening exhaustion and
morning soreness; as it had earlier, on their overland voyage when they
searched for water, time again seemed to Andrews to hold itself apart
from the passing of the days.

p.213/4:

[p.213:] <P> Much of the time he slept; ...  [p.214:] Awake, his mind
was torpid and unsure, and it moved as sluggishly as his
blood. Thoughts, unoccasioned and faint, drifted vaguely into his mind
and out. He half remembered the comforts of his home in Boston; but that
seemed unreal and far away, and of those thoughts there remained in his
mind only thin ghosts of remembered sensation -- the feel of a feather
bed at night, [etc.].
<P>
He thought of Francine. He could not bring her image to his mind, and he
did not try; he thought of her as flesh, as softness, as warmth. Though
he did not know why ..., he thought of her as a part of himself that
could not quite make another part of himself warm. Somehow he had pushed
that part away from him once. He felt himself sinking toward that
warmth; and cold, before he met it, he slept again. <P>[end of chapter]

p.239/240:

[p.239:] <P> Week by week, and at last month by month, the men endured
the changing weather. ... Day slipped into indistinguishable day, and
week into week; Andrews had no sensation of passing time, nothing
against which to measure the coming thaw of spring. Every now and then
he looked at the notches in a stripped pine branch that Schneider had
made to keep track of the days; dully, mechanically, he counted them,
but the number had no meaning for him. He was made aware of the passing
of the months by the fact that at regular intervals Schneider came up to
him and asked him for his month's pay. At such times, he solemnly
counted from his [p.240:] money belt the money Schneider demanded,
wondering vaguely where he kept it after he got it. But even this gave
him no consciousness of passing time; it was a duty he performed when
Schneider asked him; it had nothing to do with the time that did not
pass, but which held him unmoving where he was.
