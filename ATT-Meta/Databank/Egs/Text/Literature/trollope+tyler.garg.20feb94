On the second day, Tim showed Anna the system in
the warehouse. On the third, he explained how to use
the computer for reordering. On the fourth day he was
off sick, and Mr Mulgrove asked Anna if she thought
she could manage, and to ask Heather on flours and
dried fruits if she wasn't sure of anything. She said she
would be fine.**Indeed, to have a whole morning
undisturbed by any thoughts profounder than wonder-
ing why on earth the people of Woodborough should
consume so much tandoori curry powder, while
ignoring pesto sauce, was quite luxurious.*** But Colonel
Richardson came between Anna and the tandoori
curry powder; personable, kindly, inflexible Colonel
Richardson, who had sat in her insufficiently tidy
sitting-room in his beautiful old tweed jacket, and had
said to her that she was harming her husband, the
community and the Church. She had explained to him
about Flora, thinking that his undoubtedly benevolent
heart would be touched. It was. Harry Richardson
appalled Anna by offering to lend her Flora's school
fees, interest-free, for as long as she needed them.

  Peter put the tea tray down with difficulty on a table
already strewn with books and papers.             
  'You were-' he said. His voice was tight with
suppressed curiosity.                               
  'A Benedictine,' Daniel said. 'I decided, when I was
thirty-five, that I- was more use out than in. Fifteen
years on, I couldn't be sure of that intellectually, but
the instinct still says I'm right. We none of us listen to
instinct enough.'
  'Hear, hear,' Anna said. She poured tea.** Passing
Peter to take a cup to Daniel, she tried to catch his eye,                        to give him a little loving glance, but his expression
was withdrawn, his eyes and thoughts elsewhere.***
  Daniel watched them both. He drank his tea. He
noticed how they took chairs at some distance from
one another and from him. He debated, within himself,

whether to be oblique or direct with Peter, whose face
seemed to him both shuttered and vulnerable. He
would clearly hate to be patronized; he would smell
patronage in any apology, in any request for help
made out of desire to soothe sore feelings. Daniel
glanced at Anna, upright on her ugly dark chair, her
gaze bent on the carpet. They don't talk, Daniel
thought. They can't. I smell no honesty here. He
sighed. He said, 'May I call you Peter?'
  Peter jumped, 'Of course-'
  'We are brothers in this.'
 

                             

PAGE : 178-179 

In the sixth-form college's boys' lavatory, companion-
ably peeing side by side, Luke said to Barnaby that
home was really weird just now. Barnaby, who had
always hankered after more weirdness than his
mother's strong sense of order could stand, said how
come? Shaking himself nd then zipping up his jeans,
Luke said kind of furtive.
 'Furtive?' Barnaby said. 'Like hassle?'
 No, Luke said, not like hassle, in fact no-one was
hassling him at all. It was more a sort of atmosphere,
people not saying things when they were dying to,
Mum and Dad kind of pretending the other wasn't
there.                                                 
  Barnaby considered this very briefly and abruptly
lost interest in the whole topic. 'Want a smoke?'

 ** Later, on the last bus to Loxford, Luke's mind returned
reluctantly to the subject***.** He wasn't much surprised,
since his mind, just at present, lurched between the
disagreeableness of home, and sex.*** Sex usually won.
Luke was horrified and fascinated to find how much
he thought about it and longed for it and was afraid of
it. He couldn't see, usually, how he was actually going
to do it for the first time but he feared that if that first
time wasn't soon he'd probably explode. This state of
affairs had come upon him quite suddenly and he was
entirely at its mercy. He got erections all the time,;
without warning, and had fantasies of a slightly brutal
kind about a girl in his art-history set, a girl called
Alison with long, rough red hair and sneering eyes,

like a cat. She was reputed to have slept around since
she was fifteen. Luke's imagination returned con-
stantly to what, if this were true, she might know that
he did not. The power that she would have in
possessing such knowledge made him almost sick
with excitement. It also made this daily departure from
Woodborough, where Alison lived and where she
lounged about in the evening with Barnaby and a
group of others, almost unbearable. Add to that the
atmosphere in the Rectory, and Luke sometimes
thought he couldn't take any more.
 **And yet... There was some little haunting thing
about his mother that sang in Luke's mind.*** Ever since
she'd come back from Oxford, she'd seemed secret,
shut away, but the secret clearly wasn't a thrill like the
secret of Alison, it was something sad, as if something
had got broken. Luke didn't want to talk about it
because he didn't really think he could cope with
being confided in, but the look of her made him
uneasy and sorry. His conscience drove him home,
and then his feelings of being helpless and discon-
certed drove him out again, to the Old Rectory, to cut
the edges of Patrick's lawn, and polish Patrick's car
and rake Patrick's gravel and to feel, as he did so, the
healing balm of Patrick's prosperity and assurance.

  'All the time.'
  Mr Biddle licked his lips. 'Wimmin from London?'
  Luke nodded. 'Belly dancers.'
  'Cor,' Mr Biddle said. He let Luke go.-He sketched
huge breasts on the front of his jacket and grinned. 'In
the war ' began Mr Biddle.
  'I'm late,' Luke said. 'I'm supposed to be working for
him. Got to get the spuds in.'
  'Spuds?' Mr Biddle said. He gave a little cackle.
**Luke did not, despite lurking thoughts of Alison,
want to know what spuds reminded Mr Biddle of.***
'Gotta go,' he said.
  Mr Biddle nodded. He took a step back, his glance
suddenly clouded. Belly dancers! In Cairo, in 1942,
he'd been offered a little girl, she couldn't have been
more than ten. He hadn't remembered that for twenty
years; he wished he hadn't remembered it now. He
squinted at Luke. 'You take care.' His voice wavered a
little. 'You take care around that O'Sullivan. Money
ain't to be trusted.'
          



PAGE : 202-203

  Anna also thought about Jonathan. What astonished
her was not so much that she had been to bed with him
- and was now an adulteress - but that it should have
been so natural to do so, and even more, so natural in
its doing. Her every dealing with the Byrne brothers
had been characterized by sheer ease, from that first
drive to Loxford with Daniel, to Jonathan saying into
her shivering skin, 'And do you like this? And this?
But not that?' She had slipped along in her relationship
with them like a fish in a stream, seeing at last, because
of them, her passage clear to the sea. She was perfectly
certain that she would continue to go to bed with
Jonathan and that her love for him would grow until -
she looked at Peter's surpliced back before the altar -
until she saw unquestionably what she should do next.

For the moment, she would just gratefully draw
strength from this astonishing new source.** A thought       
shot into her mind like a bolt from the blue.***Had
Jonathan actually been offered to her?
  Going out of church, she and Laura were accosted
by Patrick. He shook hands fervently.
  'I'd adore you,' he said to Laura, 'to see my garden.'
  'Dear boy, I'm hopeless at gardens.'
  He said, 'Hopeless?'
  'Can't see the point of them. But mountains! Ah now,
mountains
  Patrick, sensing he might be being made fun of,
stepped back a little. 'Can't offer you those, I'm afraid.'

               


PAGE : 209-210

  He sat in the north side of the choir stalls and looked
out at the waving plumes of a willow tree in the
churchyard. He did not really see it, any more than he
saw the sky beyond it, or the greyish stone window
that framed it. He was conscious of very little except
the quiet and his unhappiness, which filled his whole
being like cold, still water. It was water he was afraid
to disturb, to dive into, because he couldn't bear even
to begin to analyze why he felt as he did.** He shrank
from his thoughts, just as, these days, he shrank from
Anna.*** If their limbs brushed each other in bed, he
could feel his withdrawing, flinching. In the same way,
his eyes turned away from meeting hers when they
spoke. He was terribly afraid that he was going mad.
Long ago, as a theology student, he had had a crisis
about prayer, a period of alarming doubt. His tutor, a
man of enormous experience in ministerial matters,
had simply counselled him not to struggle. Throw out
the idea of God, he had said, just forget it. Think

instead about something about which there can't be
personal anguish, something more abstract, like a
desire to be good or kind, or the wish to love, and voice
that wish in your mind, over and over.

  'So tactful,' Mrs Maxwell said, rushing on, pressing
her dustsheet to her bosom in her enthusiasm. 'I mean,
if you don't mind my mentioning it, they make no
distinction between the fee-paying children and the
free-place ones. I shouldn't think the other children
even know. Emma certainly doesn't know about
Flora.'
  Peter came out of the choir stalls. 'I beg your
pardon?'
  Mrs Maxwell blushed. How clumsy and stupid to
bring it up! Probably little Flora didn't even know
herself.
  'I'm so sorry. I've no tact. Please forget I ever said
such a thing.'
  **A small light was dawning in Peter's comprehen- 
sion. He said quietly to Mrs Maxwell, 'Please don't
worry. Don't think of it.'***
  She nodded. She said quickly, wishing to make
amends, 'I hope you know that Flora is welcome any
time, at our house. Very welcome.'
  'Thank you,' Peter said, 'thank you.' He smiled
again. 'And now I'll leave you to your flowers.'
  He drove home in a very different mood. The par-
alysis of unhappiness had abruptly given way to the
energy of anger. He left the car in the drive and hurried
into the house. The telephone number for St Saviour's
was written up, in red, on the emergency list that Anna
had stuck to the wall. Peter dialled it. He stood up
straight by the telephone, almost to attention, looking
out of the window. The school secretary answered.




PAGE : 225

 Heather from flours and dried fruits said, 'Don't
blame you. Who wants to spend their life stacking
bleeding sultanas?'
  Anna took her last pay envelope, drank her last cup
of subsidised canteen coffee, hung up her blue overall
and went out into the market-place. In her bag, she
carried the plastic badge she had worn, the badge
which said, 'I'm Anna. Can I help you?' Glancing up at
the sky; behind whose high summer clouds dwelt that
inscrutable power whose presence she could not quite
get out of her mind, **she thought of her badge and its
slogan, and said to herself: It wouldn't hurt You to
wear one . . .***

Being market day, Woodborough was full; The country
buses brought people in after breakfast and took them
away before lunch, their carrier bags bulging with fish
from the woman who travelled up from Devon, jeans
and T-shirts from the Pakistanis who travelled down
from Birmingham and cheese from the man who made
his own from herds kept in pastures not five mile
from Woodborough.




PAGE : 225-226

  Flora couldn't cuddle, never had been able to. She
lay awkwardly against Anna for a few minutes, then
bumped a clumsy kiss on her, climbed out of bed
again and padded back to her room. Peter didn't stir.
Missing Flora, Anna took revenge upon his stillness by
wishing the bed was just hers.
  Now she looked at the strawberries. Should she buy
another punnet for Peter? Would he notice? Was he

remotely concerned as to whether she gave him
strawberries or a banana? Or a black eye? She glanced
at her watch. Half an hour before she collected Flora,
half an hour in which to dawdle about Woodborough
**while her mind scurried round and round its new trap,
like a mouse on a wheel.***
  She left the market-place and turned down Sheep
Street, a narrow street forbidden to traffic which
Woodborough Council had dotted with tree-shaded
benches usually occupied by clumps of dismal teen-
agers waiting, without much hope, for action. Ahead
of Anna, a tall young woman was pushing a pram. She
stopped the pram outside a newsagent, stooped to pick
up the baby (it was new, Anna could see, from its size
and the swaddled oblivion of its tiny head), and then,
as if recollecting something, abruptly put the baby
back, tucked it in decisively and pushed the pram
onwards.




PAGE : 229

Daniel and Jonathan Byrne sat in Daniel's study. They
had not put any lamps on, because the light was fading
so beautifully outside the window that it seemed a pity
to outshine it. Miss Lambe had given them coleslaw for
supper, and **Daniel was revolving in his mind how to 
tell her tactfully that he found coleslaw disgusting.*** He
thought he might say that it gave him indigestion (it
didn't; nothing did) because that would let them both
out so easily. Caring for the tenderness of Miss Lambe's
feelings - as small and vulnerable as seedlings - was
becoming an exhausting and full-time job.
  Jonathan was not thinking about coleslaw. He was
less chivalrous towards Miss Lambe - perversely, she
adored his mild carelessness towards her - and
simply hadn't eaten his, pushing the pale, glistening
heap to the side of his plate, and leaving it there. 
                         



PAGE : 230

He was thinking about Anna, and about Luke, whom he
was getting to know and getting to like. Luke's
conscience was deeply troubled at leaving home, at
abandoning his mother, but, as he could see no way to
improve anything, and was being driven demented by
the atmosphere, getting out had seemed the only
course. He had said this quite directly to Jonathan, on
their second meeting, and Jonathan had said there was
only point and merit to sacrifice as long as it achieved
something. The next natural step would have been to
talk about Anna, but both avoided it. Jonathan had
talked to no-one about Anna; he simply thought about
her.                                                
  He said to Daniel now, 'I want to tell you something.'
 **Daniel's mind, which had abandoned coleslaw for
  tomorrow's meeting with the Bishop, came swiftly
  back.*** 'Of course.'
  'I'm in love with Anna Bouverie.'
  There was a fractional pause and then Daniel said,
'Yes, I know.'
  'How do you know?'
  'Little things. Remarks. The look of you.'      
  'And?'                                         
  'What do you mean?'                              
  'Does a sermon follow? Will you try and stop-me?'
  'Have I ever,' Daniel said, 'tried to stop you doing
anything?'
  'But what about Peter Bouverie? He's a priest of
yours-'                                          
  'Are you asking me to make up your mind?'
  'Oh no,' Jonathan said, 'I've done that. I want to 
marry her.' 




PAGE : 235-236

  She reached the lane and squared her shoulders.
Across the village green, Elaine Dodswell was planting
petunias in two urns that guarded her little bridge in
summer, in addition to the frogs. A pang of envy seized
Ella. What wouldn't she give, at that moment, for a
cottage of her own, with her own untroublesome
petunias, instead of this ill-defined life, half prefect,
half parasite, on the coat tails of Patrick O'Sullivan's
wishes and whims? She quickened her steps and
Elaine, seeing her, brandished a trowel at her and
called out the offer of a cup of tea. Thankful for
the distraction, Ella nodded, and hurried towards
her.

After Ella had gone, Peter went into the sitting-room
and sat carefully on the sofa.** He sat there for a long
time, slipping his thoughts through his mind like the
beads on a rosary.*** One thing was very plain and that
was that he wasn't at all surprised; indeed, he felt
almost relieved to know the key to Anna's extraordi-
nary behaviour recently. What was more, knowing the
key, being in power by possessing his new knowledge,
made him feel, for the first time in months, curiously
elated. He looked around the room, reduced once more
to its habitual untidiness, and found he even wanted to
smile. It was such a relief, such a violent, savage,
unspeakable relief to know that he hadn't imagined
things after all, that his revulsion from Anna had been
instinctive - rightly instinctive - and that he wasn't,
oh, joy of joys, going off his head. **His unconscious
mind had known what his conscious mind had refused
to know.*** In a curious way, he felt himself to be free, as

if shackles had fallen from him. He found that he was
trembling.
  He got up and began to pace the room, rhythmically 
banging one closed fist into the other open hand. His
father used to do that, and it always, Peter remem-
bered, made Kitty nervous because she never knew
how to react to her husband's perturbations of spirit,
being incapable of either dealing with them or leaving
them alone. Peter thought of Kitty with great affection.
There was a loyal woman! A selfless, devoted, faithful
woman! He forgot that most of his life she had almost
driven him mad with her indecisiveness, her fluttering
mind, and that it was Anna who had kept up
communication with her.

 "So I told her,'It's cheaper by parcel post , you know.
That would be four sixty-three.' 'Let me think,' she
says, and moves on out of the way. Gives up her place
at the counter. Stands a few feet down from me, frown-
ing at the wall."
  "I had to take a minute to decide," Lucy explained.
  ''Frowns at the wall for the longest time. Three cus-
tomers go ahead of her. Finally I say, 'Miss? You
ready?' But she just goes on frowning."
  "I was mailing some odds and ends to my ex-husband
and I wanted to be shed of them as fast as possible,''
Lucy said.      -                -
  A little jolt passed through the room.
  Bee said, "Ex-husband?"
  **"Half of me wanted him to get that box tomorrow,
even yesterday if it could be arranged, but the other
half was counting pennies. 'That's fifteen-and-some
dollars' difference,' this other half was saying.***'Think
of all the groceries fifteen dollars could buy. Or shoes
and stuff for the children.' "
  "Children?"
  "What got to me," Danny said, "was how she
wouldn't be hurried. How it didn't bother her what other
people made of her. I mean she just stood there pon-
dering, little bit of a person. Then finally she said,
'Well,' and straightened her shoulders and chose to
spring for airmail."
  "It mattered just enough, I decided," Lucy said. "It
was worth it just for the satisfaction."
  "If she had said parcel post I might have let her go,''
Danny said. "But airmail! I admired that. I asked if
she'd like to have dinner."
 



PAGE : 6-7              
   
  As for Ian, he believed it too but only after a kind of
hitch, a moment of hesitation. For instance, from time
to time he had the feeling that his father was something
of a joke at Poe High--ineffectual at discipline, and
muddled in his explanation of the more complicated
algebraic functions. But Bee said he was the most pop-
ular teacher Poe had ever employed, and in fact that
was true. Yes, certainly it was true. Ian knew she was
right.
  Or look at Claudia. The family's one scholar, she had
dropped out of college her senior year to get married,
and then the babies started coming so thick and so fast
that they had to be named alphabetically: **Abbie, Bar-
ney, Cindy, Davey . . . Where would it all end? some
cynical voice inquired from the depths of Ian's mind.***
Xavier? Zelda? But his mother said she hoped they
would progress to double letters--Aaron Abel and Bon-
nie Belinda--like items on a crowded catalog page.

Then Ian saw Claudia's children as a tumbling hodge-
podge heaped in a basket, and he was forced to smile.




PAGE : 7

  Or Danny. Wasn't it sort of a comedown that Danny
had gone to work at the post offlce straight out of high
school, when both sides of the family as far back as
anyone could remember had been teachers? ("Educa-
tors," Bee called them.) But Bee pointed out how lucky
he was, knowing so early in life what he wanted and
settling in so contentedly. Then Ian readjusted; he
shifted gears or something and whir! he was rolling
along with the others, impressed by Danny's good for-
tune.
  **He had always assumed he was the only one who
experienced that hitch in his thoughts.*** He assumed it 
until the day Lucy arrived, when he felt his parents'
hidden start at the word "ex-husband." Wait. The girl
of Danny's dreams had chosen someone else before
him? And was saddling him with someone else's chil-
dren besides? His father looked confused. His mother's
broad face developed a brittle, tight surface, like some-
thing easily broken.

  Agatha never thought about Danny anymore.
  "I have to pee," Thomas whispered.
  "What, again?"
  He slid out of bed and hitched up his pajama bot-
toms. "It was too much grapefruit juice," he said.
  Agatha leaned against her pillow and folded her alms
and watched him go. The cigarette smoke from the liv-
ing room made her nose feel crinkly inside. Wasn't it
strange how dead butts smelled so dirty, but lighted -
cigarettes smelled exciting and promising.
  **Something nagged at her mind, a bothersome thought -
she couldn't quite get hold of.*** Then she noticed what
she was hearing: the flushing of the toilet. Oh, no. She
threw back her covers and started out of bed.
  Too late, though. Thomas shrieked, "Mama!
Mama!" and their mother cried, "Thomas?" Her bare
feet came rushing down the hall. Her kimono made a
crackling sound like fire.
  Agatha decided to stay where she was.
  "Oh, my God," her mother said. "Oh, my Lord in
heaven.''
  She must be standing in the bathroom doorway. Her
voice echoed off the tiles. 




PAGE : 104-105

  ''We think they'll have a fine time staying here with 
Mrs. Myrdal," Bee said. "Mrs. Myrdal used to sit with
them when they lived above the drugstore and she knows
all their favorite storybooks."                      - -
  She beamed across the table at Agatha. Agatha gazed
back at her without a trace of a smile.
  Dr. Prescott said, "Agatha, Thomas, I realize all

that's happened must be difficult to understand. Perhaps
you'd like to ask me some questions."
  Agatha remained expressionless. Thomas shook his 
head.
 **Ian thought, I would! I would! But it wasn't Ian Dr.
Prescott had been addressing.***

He'd remembered to bring his suit but he had forgotten
a tie, so he had to borrow one of his father's for the fu-
neral. Standing in front of his mirror, he slid the
knot into place and smoothed his collar. When the
doorbell rang, he waited for someone to answer. It rang
again and Beastie gave a worried yap. "Coming!" Ian
called. He crossed the hall and sprinted downstairs.




PAGE : 117-118

  By the time he returned to school on Sunday evening,
he had almost persuaded Cicely to see a doctor. What
he hoped for (although he didn't say it) was a doctor
who could offer her a magic pill or something. There
must be such a pill. Surely there was. Maybe it was
some common cold remedy or headache tablet, avail-
able on open shelves, with NOT TO BE TAKEN DURING
PREGNANCY imprinted on the label--a message in code
for those who needed it. But if he mentioned this to

Cicely she might t_hink he didn't want to marry her or
something, when of course he did want to and had al-
ways planned to. Just not yet, please, God. Not when
he'd never even slept with a dark-haired girl yet. 
 ** He flinched at the wickedness of this thought, which
had glided so smoothly into his mind that it might have
been there all along.***                             
  In Biology 101 on Tuesday, his lab partner said she'd
noticed him on the church bus. She wondered if he'd
like to attend the Wednesday Night Youth Group at her
place of worship. "Oh, I'm sorry, I can't," he said
 instantly. "I've got a paper due."
  "Well, maybe another time, then," she said. "We
always have such fun! Usually they show a movie,
 something nice and clean with no language.''      
   "It does sound like fun," he said.

   "Friends," the minister said, in a sensible, almost
conversational tone. "And guests," he added, nodding
at Ian. All over again, the others turned and smiled.
Ian smiled back, maybe a little too broadly. He had the
feeling he was their first and only visitor.
  "We have reached that point in the service," the
minister said, "when any person here is invited to step
forward and ask for our prayers. No request is too great,
no request is trivial in the eyes of God our Father."
  Ian thought of the plasterer who'd repaired his par-
ents bathroom ceiling. NO JOB TOO LARGE OR TOO
SMALL, his panel truck had read. **He brushed the thought
away.*** He watched a very fat young woman heave her-
self to her feet just in front of him. The width of her
sprigged, summer-weight skirt, when she finally
reached a standing position, completely blocked his
view of the minister. "Well, Clarice as you may have
heard is down real bad with her blood," she said
breathily. "We had thought that was all behind her but
now it's come on back, and I asked what I could do for
her and she says, 'Lynn,' says, 'take it to Wednesday
Night Prayer Meeting, Lynn, and ask them for their
prayers.' So that's just what I'm doing."

 It's not till then the fellow behind him says,
'Wait!' Says, 'Wait, you forgot your-- "
  "Parachute," Ian's neighbor finished sadly.
  "So I don't ask your prayers for Chuckie after this; I
ask for me," the woman said. For the first time, her
voice was unsteady. "I'm just about sick with grief, I
tell you. Pray for me to find some deliverance."
  She sat down, fumbling behind her for her purse. The
minister lifted his palms and the room fell silent.
  Could you really forget your parachute?
  Well, maybe so. Ian could see how it might have
come about. A man to whom jumping was habit might
imagine that floating in space was all his own doing,
like flying. Maybe it had slipped his mind he couldn't
fly, so in the first startled instant of his descent he sup-
posed he had simply forgotten how. He may have felt
insulted, betrayed by all he'd taken for granted.** What's
the big idea here? he must have asked.***
  Ian pictured one of those animated films where a
character strolls off a cliff without noticing and contin-
ues strolling in midair, perfectly safe until he happens
to look down and then his legs start wheeling madly
and he plummets.
  He gave a short bark of laughter.
  The congregation swiveled and stared at him.

  Reverend Emmett studied him. (His skin was an un-
healthy shade of white, although that could have been
the fluorescent lighting.) "But your prayer," he said
finally. "Was there any response?"
  "Response? "
  "Did you get a reply?"
  "Well, not exactly."
  "I see," Reverend Emmett said. He watched an aged
couple assist each other through the door--the very last
to leave. Then he said, "What was it that you needed
forgiven?"
  Ian couldn't believe his ears. Was this even legal,
inquiring into a person's private prayers? He ought to
spin on his heel and walk out.** But instead his heart
began hammering as if he were about to do something
brave.*** In a voice not quite his own, he said, "I caused
my brother to, um, kill himself."
  Reverend Emmett gazed at him thoughtfully.
  "I told him his wife was cheating on him," Ian said
in a rush, "and now I'm not even sure she was. I mean
I'm pretty sure she did in the past, I know I wasn't
totally wrong, but . . . So he drove into a wall. And
then his wife died of sleeping pills and I guess you
could say I caused that too, more or less . . . "

 It turned out, though, he didn't have a knack for discussing
things. You read a story; it's good or it's bad. What's to
discuss? The other people in the class, they could ram-
ble on forever. Halfway through the course, he just
stopped attending.
  He retreated to the basement, then. He built a toy
chest for his youngest grandchild--a pretty decent ef-
fort, although Ian (Mr. Artsy-Craftsy) objected to par-
ticleboard. Also, carpentry didn't give him quite enough
to think about.**Left a kind of empty space in his mind
that all sorts of bothersome notions could rush in and
fill.***
  Once in a while something needed fixing; that was
always welcome. Bee would bring him some household
object and he would click his tongue happily and ask
her, "What did you do to this?" 
  "I just broke it, Doug, all right?" she would say. "I
deliberately went and broke it. I sat up late last night
plotting how to break it."                       
  And he would shake his head, feeling gratified and
important.                                       
  Such occasions didn't arise every day, though, or even
every week. Not nearly enough to keep him fully oc-
cupied.

  Ian said, "Agatha, it's very bad manners to criticize
other people's religion."
  "It's very bad manners to force your own religion on
them, too," Agatha told him. "Shoot, it's very uncon-
stituional. To make me go to church when I don't want
to.
  "Well, you're right," Ian said.
  "Huh?"
  "You're right, I shouldn't have done it."
  By now, they had stopped walking. Agatha peered at
him. She said, "So can I leave now?"
  "You can leave."
  She stood there a moment longer. The other two
watched with interest. "Okay," she said finally. "Bye."
  "Bye."
  She tumed and set off toward home.
  But without her it seemed so quiet. He missed her
firm, opinionated voice and that little trick she had of
varying her tone to quote each person's remarks. No
matter how imaginary those remarks might be.


"I the Lord thy God am a jealous God," Reverend
Emmett read from Exodus, and** Ian could almost hear
Agatha beside him: "Any time we act jealous, people
have a fit." He shook the thought away.*** He bowed lower
in his seat, propping his forehead on two fingers. Next
to him, Daphne tore a tiny corner off a page of her
hymnal and placed it on her tongue. Thomas was sitting

behind them with Kenny Larson and his family.A fly
was crawling up the front counter.

  "She must've had a safe deposit box." 
  "Lucy? I doubt it. And where was the key,then?"
  "So you are trying to tell me," Eli said, "that a
person manages to get through life without a single sol-
itary piece of paper in her possession."
  "Well, I realize it's unusual-"
  "It's impossible! "
  "Well. . ."                           
  "Had her place been burglarized recently? Did the
drawers look like they'd been rifled?"         
  "Not that I heard of," Ian said.          
  "Was anybody else living in the house with her?"
   No . . ."                             
 ** But a dim uneasiness flitted past him, like somehing
you see and yet don't see out of the corner of your eye.***
  "Anyone suspicious hanging about her?" 
  "No,no ... "
  **But wary, suspicious Agatha pushed into his mind-
her closed-off face with the puffy lids that veiled
secret thoughts.***
  "Now, I don't want you to take this wrong,"Eli
said, "but you are about the most unhelpful client I ever
had to deal with. "
  "I realize that. I'm sorry," Ian said. "I shouldn't
have wasted your time."
  **Eli shook his head, and his cowlick waggled and
dipped. God's arrow with no place to go, Ian couldn't
help thinking.***

Monday noon, he told Mr.Brant he was eating at home
today. He drove home and let himself into the house,
announcing, "It's me! Forgot my billfold!"
  "Oh, hello, dear," his mother called from the
kitchen. Then she and his father went on talking, no 
doubt over their usual lunch of tinned soup and saltine 
crackers.

  Ian looked at him a moment. His mind had drifted
elsewhere. "Thomas,"hesaid, "rememberthatbig
doll you used to carry around?"
  "Oh, well, that was a long time ago," Thomas said.'
  "Yes, but I was wondering. How come you named
her Dulcimer?"
  "I don't even know where she is anymore. I don't
know why I named her that," Thomas said.
  He seemed embarrassed, rather than secretive. And 
Agatha wasn't listening. You'd think she would suspect;
she was the one who'd kept that box hidden away. But
she stirred the porch swing dreamily with one foot.
"Suppose we got bombed," she said to Ian.
  "Pardon? "
  **He saw the stationery box in his mind: the dust on
the lid, the congealed sheaf of papers. She must not
have glanced inside for years, he realized. She might
even have forgotten it existed.***

  "Suppose Baltimore got atom-bombed," she was
saying. ''Know what I'd do?''
  "You wouldn't do a thing," Thomas told her. "You'd
be dead."
  "No, seriously. I've been thinking. I'd break into a
supermarket, and I'd settle our family inside. That way
we'd have all the supplies we needed. Canned goods
and bottled goods, enough to last us forever."
  "Well, not forever," Thomas said.

I told her I was a buddy of Tom,s wanting to get in
touch with him. I didn't say no more though till I got
your say-so. Should I go ahead now and pay her a
visit? "
  "No, never mind."
  "She's bound to know the kids' relatives. Small-town
kind of lady; you could just tell she would know all
about it."
  "Maybe I should get her address," Ian said.
  "Okay, suit yourself. Mrs. Margie Millet. Forty-three
Orchard Road, Portia, Maryland. You need to write that
down?"
  "I have it," Ian said.** (He would have it forever, he
felt--chiseled into his brain.)*** "Thanks, Eli. I appreci-
ate your help. You know where to send the bill."
  "Aw, it won't amount to much. This one was easy."
  **For you, maybe, Ian thought.*** He told Eli goodbye
and hung up.
  From the kitchen, his mother called, "Agatha? Time
to set the table!"
  "Coming."
  Ian met Agatha at the door and stepped past her onto
the porch. She didn't notice a thing.
  The evening was several shades darker now, as if cur-
tain after curtain had fallen in his absence. Thomas was
swinging the swing hard enough to make the chains
creak, and down on the sidewalk the little girls were
still playing hopscotch. Ian paused to watch them.
Something about the purposefill planting of small shoes
within chalked squares tugged at him. **He leaned on the
railing and thought, VVhat does this remind me of?
What? What?***Daphne tossed the pebble she used as a
marker and it landed in the farthest square so crisply,
so ringingly, that the sound seemed thrown back from
a sky no higher than a ceiling, cupping all of Waverly
Street just a few feet overhead.

  Surely private detectives were sworn to secrecy,
weren't they? Just like lawyers, or doctors. Weren't
they?                                         
  Reverend Emmett looked uncertain. He said,
"Well . . ." and glanced around at the other worship-
ers. His eyes did not linger noticeably on Ian, although
of course he must suspect. "Does this person wish to
ask for our prayers?" he said.
  No response. Just a few rustles and whispers.
  "In that case," Reverend Emmett said, "we won't
intrude. Let us pray, instead, for all of us. For all of us
to know that we can bring our problems to God when
ever we feel ready to let go of them."             '
 He raised his arms and the silence fell, as if he had
somehow cast it forth in front of him.            
 **Sister Bertha is a nosy-bones, Ian thought distinctly.***
And I hate that tomato-soup color she dyes her hair.
  After the Benediction, he was the first one out the
door. He left behind even Mrs. Jordan, who most likely
would want to walk home with him, and he set off at a
brisk, angry pace. So the last thing he expected to hear
was Reverend Emmett calling his name. "Brother Ian!"
  Ian stopped and turned.

  Her bus was undergoing some heater problems, and
by the time she reached home she was chilled through.
Still in her jacket, she went directly to the kitchen and
lit the gas beneath the kettle. Ian must be working late
this evening. **She could hear her grandfather down in
the basement, rattling tools and thinking aloud, but she
didn't call out to him.*** Maybe there was some advantage
to living alone after all--not dealing with other people,
not feeling responsible for other people's happiness
Although that was out of the question, now that she had
no salary.  
  She took a mug from the cupboard, where everything
sat in straight rows--eight mugs, eight short glasses,
eight tall glasses. The mugs that didn't match and the
odd-sized glasses had been sent to Good Works. The
cereals that people had tried once and never again had
disappeared from the shelves. In just three days Rita
had turned this house into a sort of sample kit: on
perfect set of everything. But Daphne hadn't quite ad-
justed yet and she felt a little rustle of panic. She wanted
some extras. She wanted that crowd of cracked, crazed
chipped, handleless mugs waiting behind the other mugs
on the off chance they might be needed.        
  She ladled coffee into the drip pot and then poured
in the boiling water. Coffee was her weakness.** Rever
end Emmett said coffee clouded the senses, coffee
stepped between God and the self; but Daphne had dis-
covered long ago that coffee sharpened the senses, and
she loved to sit through church all elated and jangly-
I nerved and keyed to the sound of that inner voice saying
enigmatic things she might someday figure out*** when                                 
she was wiser: if not for you, if not for you, if not for
you and down in the meadow where the green grass
grows . . . She waited daily for caffeine to be declared
illegal, but it seemed the government had not caught
on yet.

  Up ahead, Stuart was asking all about the Church of
the Second Chance. He wanted to know how sizable a
membership it had, when it had been founded, what its
tax status was. You could tell he was only making con-
versation, but Ian answered each question gladly and at
length. He said that Second Chance had saved his life.
Doug, walking in front wth Thomas, coughed and said,
"Oh, well, ah . . ." but Ian insisted, "It did, Dad. You
know it did."
  He told Stuart, "Sometimes I have this insomnia. I
fall asleep just fine but then an hour or so later **I wake
up, and that's when the troublesome thoughts move in. ***
You know? Things I did wrong, things I said wrong,
mistakes I want to take back. And I always wonder, 'If
I didn't have Someone to turn this all over to, how would
I get through this? How do other people get through
it?' Because I'm surely not the only one, am I?"  '
  They had reached an intersection now, and they
waited on the curb while a spurt of traffic passed. Aga-
tha clutched her coat collar tight and glanced over at
Daphne. There was something meaningful in the way
she narrowed her eyes. **And you didn't want me to invite ?
a girlfriend for him, she must be saying.***
  "You know that clock downstairs that strikes the
number of hours,'' Ian told Stuart. "And then it strikes
once at every half hour. So when you hear it striking
once, you can't be certain how much of the night you've
used up. Is it twelve-thirty, or is it one, or is it one-
thirty? You have to just lie there and wait, and hope
with all your heart that next time it will strike two.** Or
what's worse, some nights it starts striking one, two,
three and you say, 'Ah!' And then four, five and you
say, 'Can this be? Have I really slept through till dawn?'***
And then six, seven and you say, 'Oh-oh,' because you

can see it's not that light out. And sure enough, the 
clock goes on to twelve, and you brace yourself for 
another six hours till morning."                    
  The street was clear now and they could have crossed,
but instead they stood watching him. It was Agatha who
finally spoke. "Oh, Ian," she said. "Oh, damnit. How
much longer are you going to be on your own?"
  ''Why, not long at all," he told her.            
  They squinted at him in the sunlight.
