[NP] When the first installment [of money in payment for a publicity
task] appeared in her bank account, Dolly's relief was so immense that
it almost obliterated the tiny anxious muttering voice inside her: _Your
client is a genocidal dictator._ Dolly had worked with shitheads before,
God knew; if she didn't take this job someone else would snap it up;
being a publicist is about not judging your clients -- these excuses
were lined up in formation, ready for deployment should that small
dissident voice pluck up its courage to speak with any volume. But
lately, Dolly couldn't even hear it. [EP]
