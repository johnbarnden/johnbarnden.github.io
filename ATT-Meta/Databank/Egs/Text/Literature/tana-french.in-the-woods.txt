p.161:

[NP] I thought about the question [about what two of the narrator's
childhood friends were like] for a long time. My memories of them had
rubbed thin with overuse, worn to frail colour transparencies flickering
on the walls of my mind: Jamie scrambling intent and surefooted up to a
high branch, Peter's laugh arcing out of the _trompe-l'oeil_ dazzle of
green ahead. Through some slow sea-change they had become children out of a
haunting storybook, bright myths from a lost civilisation; it was hard
to believe they had once been real and my friends.[EP]


p.242:

[NP] I had started trying -- for the first time, really -- to remember
what had happened in that wood. I prodded tentatively around the edges
of it, barely acknowledging even to myself what I was doing, like a kid
picking at a scab but afraid to look. I went for long walks
... wandering through the city for hours in something like a trance,
listening for delicate little noises in the corners of my mind. ...

[NP] To some extent, at least, it worked. Unleashed, my mind threw out
great streams of images like a slide show running on fast-forward, and
gradually I learned the knack of reaching out to catch one as they flew
past, holding it lightly and watching as it unfurled in my hands.
