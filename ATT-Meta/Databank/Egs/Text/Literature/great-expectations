Charles Dickens, ``Great Expectations''
=====================================
Oxford, UK: Heinemann Educational Books


p.195: ... so I loitered in the country on Miss Havisham's side of town
... thinking about my patroness [Miss H.], and (* PAINTING BRILLIANT PICTURES
OF *) her plans for me.[EP]

p.270: [NP] All the truth of my position (* CAME FLASHING ON ME;*) and its
disappointments, dangers, disgraces, consequences of all kinds, (* RUSHED IN IN
SUCH A MULTITUDE *) that I was borne down by them and had to struggle for every
breath I drew.[EP]

p.272: ``... And this way (* I HELD STEADY AFORE MY MIND *) that I would for
certain come one day and see my boy, and make myself known to him, on his own
ground.''[EP]

p.274/5: [CHAPTER START] IT was fortunate for me that I had to take precautions
to ensure (so as far as I could) the safety of my dreaded visitor; for, (* THIS
THOUGHT PRESSING ON ME WHEN I AWOKE, HELD OTHER THOUGHTS IN A CONFUSED
CONCOURSE, AT A DISTANCE.*)[EP]

p.310: But all this time, why I was not to go home, and what had happened at
home, and when I should go home, and whether Provis was safe at home, were
(* QUESTIONS OCCUPYING MY MIND SO BUSILY, THAT ONE MIGHT HAVE SUPPOSED THERE COULD
BE NO MORE ROOM IN IT *) for any other theme. Even when I thought of Estella
... --- even then (* I WAS PURSUING, HERE, THERE AND EVERYWHERE, THE CAUTION *) Don't
go home.
