p.650:

The gun she [Bajarrat] had taken from her fallen colleague was out of bullets.

   ``__Shoot!__[ital.]'' screamed Bajarrat. ``__Kill__[ital.] me!''

   (* THUNDER CRACKED ACROSS HAWTHORNE'S MIND, BOLTS OF LIGHTNING SEARING HIS
INNER EYES, BLINDING HIS THOUGHTS *) yet leaving him the torture of outer
sight. Opposing (* WIND SHEARS OF LOATHING AND REMEMBERED LOVE COLLIDED *) as he
stared at the contorted features of the hellhound who had slept in his arms in
another time, in another life. ``Whom would I be killing?'' he asked weakly,
taking long gasps of breath. ``Dominique or the terrorist they call Bajarrat?''

   ``What does it __matter__[ital.]? Neither of us can live any longer, can't
you understand that?''

   ``(* PART OF ME DOES, ANOTHER PART ISN'T QUITE SURE.*)''
