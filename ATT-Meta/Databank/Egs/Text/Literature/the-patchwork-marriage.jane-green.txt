Jane Green: The Patchwork Marriage
==================================
London: Penguin Books, 2012


p.131: 

{The character Andi's daughter Emily has just announced she's going to
keep the baby she's bearing. The mentioned thought is for Andi and her
husband to adopt the baby as their own.}

She dabs her own tears away and takes a deep breath, ready to finally
grasp the thought that has been trying to whisper its way in from the
very edges of her consciousness. She has been only half-concentrating
on Emily, the thought growing until it takes up all the space in her
head.
