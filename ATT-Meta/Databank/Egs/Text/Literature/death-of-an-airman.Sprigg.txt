"Death of an Airman", by Christoper St John Sprigg
==================================================
London: British Library, 2015.

p.41: It was Dr. Bastable's business to notice a point like that [a
suspicious medical point about a death]. But Dr. Bastable had not noticed
it. [EP] ...

p.42: [NP] The Bishop groaned in spirit and composed his mind to the
solemn English of the graveside rites [at the burial connected to that
death].  Obstinately, the words flickered out of his mind as out of a
fog. "Why didn't the doctor notice it?" 
[NP] Towards the end of the service the words stopped flickering and
burned steadily. For the Bishop's eyes fell upon the unexpressive face
of Dr. Bastable.
