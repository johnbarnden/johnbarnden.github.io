Prologue page 1

     He was nine.  It was his first morning in England and he began to
WONDER if all English houses were like thins one, large yet with small
rooms, full of things that no one could use:  armless statues, vases
with lids to them, curtains as immovably draped as one of his mother's
evening gowns.
     They had arrived the night before and he had passed through the
hall wrapped in a blanket and carried in his father's arms.  He
REMEMBERED only the great front door, a heavy wooden door with a
picture of a tree on it in coloured glass.  They had left him to sleep
as long as he would and someone had brought breakfast for him on a
tray.

page 2

Windows?  Doors?  It SEEMED to him that they covered things people
were not supposed to see.  There was a single mirror with a wooden
frame and this frame, of carved and polished red wood, looked as if it
has grown branched of its own, for strips of wood shaped into leaves
and twigs twined across the glass.

She was holding a silver plate and in the plate was the head of a man.
     He KNEW it must be very good painting because the artist had made
it look so real.  Nothing was left out, not even the blood in the
plate and the white tube things in the man's neck where it had been
but from his body.

She was smiling and there was a strange expression on her face,
dreamy, triumphant, replete.  He had never see such a look in anyone's
eyes before but suddenly he KNEW  with an INTUITION that had IN IT
something of an a PRIOR KNOWLEDGE, that grown-ups sometimes looked
at each other like that and that they did so out of the sight of
children.
     He tore his eyes from the picture and put his hand up to his
mouth to stop them hearing his scream.

page 7

     "Prussic acid?"  The chemist was STARTLED.  He had been a member
of the Pharmaceutical Society for ten years and this was the first
time anyone had made such a request to him.

Mr. Waller was only a chemist, a pharmacist really, not a proper
chemist who worked in a laboratory.  Everyone KNEW that doctors poked
their noses into one's affairs, trying to FIND OUT things that were no
business of theirs, but not chemists.  You asked for what you
wanted--razor blades or shaving cream or a camera  film--and the
chemist gave it to you.

page 8-9

When all was said and done, Waller was only a shopkeeper.
     "I WANT it for killing wasps.  I've got a wasp nest on the wall
of my house under the roof."

     "What for?  I don't have to have a prescription for it, do I?"
     Waller IGNORED the sarcasm.  Responsible professional men must
not allow themselves to be ruffled by cheap cracks.
     "What gave you the IDEA of cyanide?"  As he spoke the curtain of
coloured plastic strips that hung across the entrance to the
dispensary parted and Linda Gaveston came out in her pink overall.

She smiled at him vaguely.  Edward snapped:
     "If you must KNOW, I read about it in a gardening book."
     Plausible, Waller thought.

"...What's it called?"
     "Vesprid."  Waller shot him a lost baleful look and turned round,
but the girl--showing off, Edward THOUGHT--was already holding the tin
towards him.  "Two and eleven."

Money flowed from it as from a spring of sweet water.  "Not quite what
one has been lad to EXPECT."  He watched Edward get into his
salesman's car, its back seat full of cardboard boxes.

Linchester business men kept short hours and the man she was looking
for might be early.  He would wave, even perhaps stop and renew his
promise to see her later, and he would NOTICE afresh how efficient she
was, how womanly.  Moreover he would SEE THAT she could look smart and
pretty not only in the evenings but also with a wash leather in her
hand.

pages 10-11

     Considering who she was looking for it was ironic that the first
car to appear was Tamsin Selby's.  Even if you didn't see the number
plate (SIN 1-A) you would KNOW it was Tamsin's Mini because, although
it was new, its black body and white roof were already marked with
raindrops and with dust, and the back seat was full of leaves and
twigs, rubbish from the fields.  Freda pursed her lips in happy
DISAPPROVAL.  If you had money and you bought nice things (what that
monogram of a number plate must have cost!) you ought to take care of them.

     Dr. Greenleaf's car followed fast on her tail.  It was time,
Freda CONSIDERED, that he bought a new one.  A doctor, she had read in
one of her magazines, was nowadays the most respected member of a
community, and therefore had appearances to keep up.

But going out to tea was a nuisance.  Now Cheryl would come rushing in
at seven just when Freda WANTED to be relaxed and ready with coffee
cups on the best traycloth, paper napkins and sherry in a decanter.
     "Ghastly these wasps."  Joan looked up at the chalet roof where
the wasps were dribbling out from under the eaves.

     "You might have shut the gates," she said from the window, but
she didn't press the point.  A wife could EXPECT small services, not a
sister.  A sister was only a housekeeper, a nanny to Edward's
motherless daughter.  Still...she cheered up.

French on Mondays and Thursdays, accountancy on Tuesdays, carpentry on
Wednesdays, car maintenance on Fridays.  Freda APPROVED his industry.
It was a way, she SUPPOSED, of FORGETTING the wife who had lived just
long enough to put the curtains up in the new house and who had died
before the first installment was due on the mortgage.

pages 12-13

He was her brother, but he was also her twin and as jealous of her
time as a husband might be.
     "Sometimes," he said, "I WONDER if you haven't got a secret
boy-friend who pops in when I'm out of the way."
     Had there been talk, gossip?

Solveig's Song, music for a cold climate, roared into the stuffy room.
The pure voice pleased Freda, REMINDING her of large uncluttered rooms
she had so far seen only from the outside as she passed with her
shopping baskets.  On the whole, she THOUGHT, she would like to live
there.  She wouldn't be squeamish.  
  
A long shudder of pain and anxious happiness travelled down from her
shoulders and along her thighs to her feet in their tight pointed
shoes.
     "I WOULDN'T LIKE that, Free," he said.  "You're best off here

with me."
     "We shall have to SEE what time brings forth, shan't we?" she
said, staring through the diamond panes at Linchester, at ten more
houses that encircled a green plot.

     "Not much doing."  He greeted Cheryl vaguely as if he was
UNCERTAIN whether or not she was one of his own children.  "Things are
a bit slack so I hied me to the bosom of my family."

     "Slack?"  She found a tablecloth and spread it on what had once
been a find unblemished sheet of teak.  "I don't LIKE the sound of
that, Den.  I'm always MEANING to talk to you about the business..."
     "Did you find anyone to sit in with the mob tomorrow night?" he
asked, adroitly changing the subject.

"...Joan found the piece of pasteboard from the melee on the
mantelpiece and read its message aloud:  'Tamsin and Patrick Selby At
Home, Saturday, July 4th, eight p.m..  Of course I KNOW how affected
Tamsin is, but At Home's going a bit far."
     "I reckon you can go as far as you like," said Denholm, "when
you've got a private income and no kids."

pages 14-19

     "Oh, don't be so silly, Den.  They've been married for years."
She had been PIQUED by his admiration of another woman, but now she
looked at him tenderly over their children's heads.  "FANCY being
married for years to Patrick Selby!"
     "I daresay it's all a matter of taste, old girl."
     "I don't KNOW what it is," Joan said, "but he frightens me.  I
get the shivers every time I see him walking past here with that great
German dog of his."

     "Pity they haven't got any kids," Denholm said wistfully.
UNCERTAIN as to whether he was WISHING children on to the Selbys from
genuine REGRET for their childlessness or from MOTIVES of revenge,
Joan gave him a sharp look.
     "They're first cousins, you KNOW."
     "Ah," said Denholm, "brought up together.  One of those boy and
girl things, was it?"
     "I don't KNOW," said his wife.  "He's not likely to confide in
anyone and she's far too much of the little girl lost."

Joan handed her husband a tea towel and began to wash up.  Jeremy's
scream made them both jump and before it had died away Denholm, who
KNEW what it meant, was out on the lawn brandishing the stick he kept
in the storm porch for this purpose.
     Only Cheryl had not backed away.

     Denholm grinned foolishly.  The Selbys, both of them, always made
him FEEL a fool.  It was the contrast, perhaps, between their
immaculate garden and his own cluttered playground; their pale
hand-stitched clothes and what he called his 'togs'; their affluence
and his need.
     "It put THE WIND UP the youngsters," he said gruffly.
     "Come on, Queenie!"  

At one the dog leaped, clearing the hedge with two inches to spare.
"I HOPE we'll see you tomorrow, Denholm?"
     "You can count on us..."

He was embarrassed and he went in quickly.  But Cheryl lingered,
staring over the hedge with curious intelligent eyes and WONDERING why
the lady who was so unlike Auntie Free had fallen to her knees under
the willow tree and flung her arms round the dog's creamy sable neck.

     Five years before when Nottinghamshire people talked about
Linchester they meant the Manor and the park.  If they were county
they REMEMBERED garden parties, if not, coach trips to a Palladian
house where you paid half-a-crown to look at a lot of valuable but
boring china while the children rolled down the ha-ha.  But all that
came to an end when old Marvell died.

One day, it seemed, the Manor was there, the next there were just the
bulldozers Henry Glide brought over from the city and a great cloud of
dust floating above the trees, grey and pancake-shaped, as if someone
had exploded a small atom bomb.
Nobody WOULD live there, they said, forgetting that commuting was
the fashion even in the provinces.  Henry himself HAD HIS DOUBTS and
he had put up three chalet bungalows before he REALISED he might be on
to a better thing if he FORGOT all about retired farmers and
CONCENTRATED on Nottingham company directors.  Fortunately, but by the
merest chance, the three mistakes were almost hidden by a screen of
elms.  He nearly LOST HIS HEAD and built big houses with small gardens
all over the estate, but he had a cautious look at the Marvell
contract and saw that there was an embargo on too much tree-felling.
His wife THOUGHT he was getting senile when he said he was only going
to put up eight more houses, eight beautiful architect-designed houses
around a broad green plot with a pond in the middle.
     And that was what people meant now when they talked about
Linchester.

Yet it was not the loveliness of the place that impressed them, the
elegant sweep of The Circle, the stone pineapples on the pillars at
the Manor gates, nor the trees, elms, oaks and sycamores, that gave
each house its expensive privacy, but the houses themselves and their
opulence.  
     OVER-AWED and at the same time SUSPICIOUS, they drove between the
pillars and into The Circle itself, looking for a house called
Hallows.
     The lorry rumbled along the road, making ruts in the melting tar
and sending white spar chips flying, past the three mistakes, past
Shaldom, The Laurels, Linchester Lodge.
     "That's the one I'd FANCY," said the driver, pointing to the
Cotswold farmhouse with a hint of Swiss chalet in its jade-coloured
balconies.  "If my pools come up."  His mate was silent, CONSUMED WITH
ENVY and with SCORN.  
     "Keep your eyes open, Reg.  It's gone knocking-off time."

pages 20-21

     Hallows was beautiful--by most people's standards.  Reg and the
driver FOUND IT on the dull side compared with its ornate neighbours.
This house was plain and rectangular, built of York stone and pale
unpolished wood; there were no gables and no chimneys, no shutters and
not a single pane of stained glass.

     "Too dreadful!"  Tamsin Selby said.  "I'd FORGOTTEN all about
it."
     It was true, she had.  The delivery parcel had been planned in a
sprightly, almost malicious MOOD, very different from her present one.
But it had taken so long in coming, so much had happened.

She disappeared through the balcony windows back into the bedroom.
     "How the rich live," Reg said to the driver.  "FORGOTTEN, my
foot!"
     Tamsin came out to them breathlessly.

     The room was too beautiful for them.  Poverty, never admitted,
scarcely FELT before, scummed their hands with ineluctable dirt.  They
looked away from the velvet curtains, the dressing-table glass ringed
with light bulbs, the half-open door that showed a glimpse of a shower
cabinet and tiles hand-painted with fishes, and down at their own
feet.

After they had gone she closed the spare bedroom door and sighed
deeply.  Patrick would be home any minute now and she had MEANT to use
those spare moments checking on everything, making sure she looked her
best.
     She went into the bedroom with the balcony and looked at herself
in the glass.

pages 22-25

The dress--that was all right at any rate.  Patrick HATED bright
colours and this one was black and white.  Plain as it was, she KNEW
there might be something too casual about it, too suggestive of a
uniform for emancipated women.  O God, she THOUGHT, making a face at
her own image and  WISHING for the first time in her life that it
could be transmuted into the reflection of a brisk blonde
\fIHausfrau\fR.
     Downstairs the table was already laid for dinner:  two place mats
of blue linen--he had made her give up using the big damask
cloths--black Prinknash plates, a long basket of French bread,
Riesling dewed from the refrigerator.  Tamsin gasped aloud when she
SAW that she had FORGOTTEN to throw away the vaseful of grasses.  She
grabbed them, scattering brown reeds, and rushed to the kitchen.

How many times had he snapped at her for wasting her days dreaming in
the garden and the fields, learning country lore from Crispin Marvell,
when she should have been at home keeping up with the Gages and the
Gavestons.
     But she must have done it and, in her panic, FORGOTTEN all about
it.  The plate of congealing horsemeat and biscuit meal was still on
the floor, untouched by the dog.

     The bitch appeared silently from the garden door, sniffed at the
food and looked enquiringly at Tamsin with mournful eyes.  She is the
only thing that we have together now, Tamsin THOUGHT, the only thing
that we both love, Kreuznacht Konigin, that we both call Queenie.  She
dropped to her knees and in her loneliness she put her arms round
Queenie's neck, feeling the suede-smooth skin against her own cheek.
Queenie's tail flapped and she nuzzled against Tamsin's ear.

     Of the two female creatures DESIROUS of pleasing Patrick it was
the dog who heard him first.  She stiffened and the swinging lethargic
tail began to wag excitedly, banging against the cooker door and
making a noise like a gong.

     Tamsin followed, her heart pounding.
     He came in slowly, not looking at her, silent, his ATTENTION
given solely to the dog.  When he had fondled Queenie, his hands
drawing down the length of her body, he looked up and saw his wife.
     Tamsin had so much to say, so many endearments REMEMBERED from
the days when it was necessary to say nothing.  No words came.

She ran the tap, rinsed her fingers.  It SEEMED an age since he had
gone--the wine, would it get too warm?  Ought she to put it back in
the fridge?

     At last he came in wearing terylene slacks and a tee shirt of
pale striped cotton, and he looked handsome if you admired men with
ash-blond hair and freckles so dense that they looked like tan.
     "I thought you'd LIKE melon," she said.  "It's canteloupe."
     SUSPICIOUSLY Patrick skimmed away the melting golden sugar.
     "Not honey, is it?  You know I HATE honey."
     "Of course it isn't."

     "Tomorrow.  It's my birthday.  You hadn't FORGOTTEN?"
     "No, it SLIPPED MY MIND, that's all."
     Had it also SLIPPED HIS MIND to get a present?
     "There's heaps to do," she said brightly.

"...And--Oh, Patrick, could you do something about the wasps?  I'm
SURE there's a nest somewhere."  She REMEMBERED belatedly and reached
for his hand.  The fingers lay inert in hers, the big red swelling
showing at the base of his thumb.

pages 26-27

     "Patrick."  Her face had paled and there were goose pimples on
her arms.  "About what you said last night--you've got to CHANGE YOUR
MIND.  You've got to FORGET all about it."  With a great effort she
pushed three words from stiff lips:  "I love you."

Her mouth was dry and she drank.  I am drinking my own sorrow, SHE
THOUGHT.  Five minutes, ten minutes passed.

     As she watched him, a pale green Ford swung into view from behind
the elms.  THAT FUNNY LITTLE SALESMAN fellow from the chalets, SHE
THOUGHT, on his way to his evening class.  She hoped he'd pass on with
a wave but he didn't.

"I love the sun."
     "Ah well, it suits you.  I can SEE THAT."
     Conversation would have to be made.

She looked up.  Patrick was still there.  "My husband--we WANT to get
rid of them but we don't KNOW how.'
     "I've got some stuff..."

pages 28-29

What had she done?  "I'm sorry but I DON'T THINK I KNOW you name."
     "Carnaby.  Edward Carnaby."

     "Wave to your Daddy."
     The child was more INTERESTED in the man and the dog on The
Green.  TELLING HERSELF that she had MEANT TO go that way in any case,
Joan followed her reluctantly.
     Patrick had never been one to waste words on the weather and
other people's health.

     "Isn't it hot?"  She was UNCOMFORTABLE in his presence and FELT
the remark had been foolish.  In fact, it was no longer particularly
hot.

A faint breeze was stirring the waters of the pond, ruffling it to
match the mackerel sky.
     "I DON'T KNOW why English people make a cult of grumbling about
the weather,"  he said.  He looked very Teutonic as he spoke and she
remembered someone had told her he had spent his childhood in Germany
and America.

She laughed awkwardly and made a grab for Cheryl's hand.  He had made
it so clear he DIDN'T WANT to talk to her that she jumped and blushed
when he called he back.
     "How's business?"

Of course he meant Denholm's business, the factory.  "All right, I
SUPPOSE," she said, and then because ever since before tea there had
been a VAGUE, HALF-FORMED WORRY NAGGING at her mind, "Den says things
have been a bit slack lately."

She looked away from him and at the dog.  Then she SAW THAT he, too,
was staring in the same direction.
     "Expansion is life," he said.  Give it a few months and then
we'll make things hum."
     Shivering a little, she drew back from him, FEELING A SUDDEN
CHILL that seemed to come not from the scurrying WIND but from the MAN
HIMSELF.  
     "We're late, Cheryl.  It's past your bedtime."

pages 30-31

     The green Ford had moved away from the Hallows gate but Tamsin
was still there, watching.  As the man and child walked off towards
the chalets, Joan suddenly THOUGHT she would go and speak to Tamsin,
demand the explanation she knew Patrick would never give to her.  But
Tamsin, she saw, was IN NO MOOD FOR talking.  Something or someone had
upset her and she was retreating up the willow drive, her head bent
and her hands clenched beneath her chin.

When she came downstairs Denholm was asleep.  He looked so like
Jeremy, his eyes lightly closed, his cheek pink and smooth against the
bunched-up cushion, that she HADN'T THE HEART to wake him.

     Tamsin stared after him, unable to smile in return.  Her knees
felt weak and SHE WAS AFRAID she might faint.  When she reached the
house she heard Queenie bark, a single staccato bark followed by a
howl.  
  
     The howls went on for a few seconds; then they stopped and all
was silent.  Tamsin KNEW what the howls meant.  Patrick had tied up
the dog to go into someone's house.

She fell on the bed and lay face-downwards.
     Half an hour had passed when she heard the footsteps and at first
she THOUGHT they were Patrick's.  But whoever it was was coming alone.

There was no accompanying tip-tap of dog's claws on stone.  O God, SHE
THOUGHT, I shall have to tell him.  Otherwise Patrick might, there in
front of everyone at the party.

He knocked with the prearranged signal.  What would he do when he KNEW
it all?  There was still a chance she could persuade Patrick.  She put
her finders in her ears, WILLING him to go.  He knocked again and it
SEEMED TO her that he must hear through glass and wood, stone walls
and think carpets, the beating of her heart.

Tamsin went into the room where the men had put the parcel.  She broke
her nails untying the string but she was crying too much TO NOTICE.

pages 32-36

     There are perhaps few things more galling to one's \fIamour
propre\fR than to act in a covert, clan-destine way when no such
discretion is necessary.  Oliver Gage was a proud man and now,
creeping round the Hallows paths, tapping signals on the glass doors,
HE FELT THAT someone had made a fool of him.
     "Damnation!" he said, this time under his breath.

Well, so much the better if that meant she had been preparing the
ground.  He would make HIS INTENTIONS clear at the party.
     He went out into The Circle and made the humiliating detour
necessary before he could find fis car that he had parked on the ride
off the main road.

Oliver lived in one of the largest houses on Linchester but it was too
small for him.  He HATED it already.  Every Friday night when he came
up from his four days in London the sight of the house, MAGNIFIED
PERHAPS IN HIS MIND during his absence, sickened him and REMINDED HIM
afresh of his misfortunes.  For, as Oliver grew older, the sizes of
his houses diminished.

One of the executives of a national daily, his income now topped the
seven thousand mark, but only about a third of this found its way into
Oliver's pocket.  The rest, never seen by him yet never FORGOTTEN,
streamed away via an army of solicitors and bank managers and
accountants into the laps of his two discarded wives.
     When he had married Nancy--pretty, witty Nancy!--and built this,
the smallest of his houses to date, he had FORGOTTEN for a few months
the other pressures of his income.  Was not love a Hercules, still
climbing trees in the Hesperides?  Now, a year later, he REFLECTED
that the gods were just and of his pleasant vices had made instruments
to plague him.
     He unlocked the door and dropped his keys on to the hall table
between the Flamenco doll and the Cherry Herring bottle that Nancy by
the addition of a shade stuck all over with hotel labels had converted
into a lamp.  

     In all his matrimonial career Oliver had never before given
houseroom to such an object.  He HATED it but he FELT THAT, in
ensuring it was the first thing his eye fell on when he entered his
home, providence was meting out to him a stern exquisite justice.
     Nancy's sewing machine could be heard faintly from the lounge.
The querulous whine of the motor FANNED HIS ILL-TEMPER INTO RAGE.  He
pushed open the reeded glass door and went in.  The room was tightly
sealed and stifling, the windows all closed and the curtains drawn
back in the way he LOATHED, carelessly, with no attention to the
proper arrangement of their folds.  Those curtains had cost him thirty
pounds.
     His wife--TO HIMSELF and to one other Oliver occasionally
REFERRED to her as his present wife--lifted her foot from the pedal
which controlled the motor and pushed damp hair back from a face on
which sweat shone.  Shreds of cotton and pieces of coloured fluff
clung to her dress and littered the floor.

("If we have wood block flooring and rugs, darling," Nancy had said,
"we'll save pounds on carpeting.")
     "This I cannot UNDERSTAND," Oliver said.  "Did I or did I not
give you a cheque for twenty pounds last Tuesday with express
instructions to buy yourself a dress?"
     
"...Tamsin always looks wonderful."
     As soon as the words were out he REGRETTED them.  Now was not the
time. 

Nancy was going to cry.  Her face swelled as if the SKIN ITSELF WAS
ALLERGIC TO HIS ANGER.
     "Tamsin has a private income."

The tears sprouted.  "I only WANTED to save you money.  That's all I
THINK about, saving you money!"
     "Oh, don't cry!..."

She almost fell from her chair into his lap and he put his arms round
her with the distaste that was part of his marital experience, the
DISTASTE THAT ALWAYS CAME AS LOVE EBBED.  Every bit of her was damp
and clinging and unbearably hot.
     "I do WANT to economise, darling.  I keep THINKING of all that
money going out month after month to Jean and Shirley.  And what with
both the boys at Bembridge..."  Oliver frowned.  He DISLIKED THE
REMINDER that he had been unable to afford to send the sons of his
first marriage to Marlborough.  "And Shirley always so greedy,
insisting on sending Jennifer to a private school when state education
is so good these days."
     "You KNOW nothing at all about state education," Oliver said.
     "Oh, darling, why did you have to marry such unattractive
women?..."

Two such disastrous--well, tragic marriages.  I lie awake at night
THINKING about the inroads on our income."
     She was off on a well-worn track, the Friday night special.

     "We'll go out to eat, then."
     "You KNOW we can't afford it.  Besides I've got to finish this
filthy dress."

     "This," said Oliver, "is the end."  Nancy, already involved once
more in fitting a huge sleeve into a tiny armhole, IGNORED HIM.  She
was not to KNOW  that it was with these words that Oliver had
terminated each of his previous marriages.  For him, too, they sounded
dreadfully like the mere echoes of happy finalities.

Must Nancy be his till death parted them?  More securely than any
devout Catholic, any puritan idealist, he had THOUGHT HIMSELF until
recently, bound to his wife.  Hercules had climbed his last tree.

pages 37-40

Her remarks as to the unattractiveness of his former wives had seemed
to denigrate his own taste and perhaps even his own personal
appearance.  But now, as he looked at himself, he FELT their
injustice.  Anyone coming in, any stranger would, he thought bitterly,
have taken Nancy for the cleaning woman doing a bit of overtime
sewing, her hair separated into rough hanks, her face greasy with heat
and effort.

     Nancy got up, shook her hair, and began to pull her dress over
head.  She was simply going to try on the limp half-finished thing but
Oliver was no fool and he could TELL from the way she moved slowly,
coquettishly, that there was ALSO INTENTION to tempt him.  
     "If you must strip in the living room you might pull the
curtains," he said.

The silk folds moved to meet each other but not before, through the
strip of narrowing glass, he had seen walking past the gate, a tall
fair man who rested a freckled hand on a dog's head, a man who was
strolling home to a beautiful well-dowered wife...
     WITH THIS GLIMPSE THERE CAME INTO HIS MIND a sudden passionate
WISH that this time things might for once go smoothly and to the
advantage of Oliver Gage.  He stood for a moment, THINKING AND
PLANNING, and then he REALISED that he had no WISH to be here like
this in the darkness with his wife, and he reached quickly for the
light switch.  

     "Ah, well," he said to his wife, "up the wooden hill."
     She had MEANT to save if all for the morning, but the hours of
sitting silently beside the sleeping man had TOLD ON HER NERVES.  His
expression became INCREDULOUS as she began to tell him of the meeting
on The Green.
     "He was pulling your leg," he said.
     "No, he wasn't.  I wouldn't have BELIEVED HIM only I KNOW you've
been WORRIED lately.  You have been WORRIED, haven't you?"
     "Well, if you must KNOW, things have been a bit dicey."  She
listened as the bantering tone left his voice.

Only when he was talking business could Denholm shed facetiousness and
become a man instead of a clown.  "It's been done through a nominee
and we don't KNOW who it is."
     "But, Den," she cried, "that must be Patrick!"
     "He wouldn't be INTERESTED in us.  Selbys are glass, nothing but
glass and we're chemicals."

     "He would.  I tell you, he is.  He's got that contract and he
MEANS to expand, to take you over.  And it does rest with him.  The
others are just--what do you call it?--sleeping partners."
     She would have to say it, put into words the grotesque fear that
had been CHURNING HER THOUGHTS the entire evening.
     "D'you KNOW what I THINK?  I THINK it's all malice, just because
you one hit that dog."
     The shot had gone home, but still he hesitated, the jovial man,
the confident provider.

His hand reached for hers and the fingers were cold and not quite
steady.  "You DON'T UNDERSTAND business.  Business men don't carry on
that way."

Would they sell if they were sufficiently tempted?
     "I UNDERSTAND people," Joan said, "and I UNDERSTAND you.  You're
not well, Den.  The strain's too much for you.  I wish you's see Dr.
Greenleaf."

"I'll have a quiet natter to him tomorrow at the party."
     "I don't WANT to go.'
     Denholm did.

"You'll have to talk to Patrick.  Oh, I WISH we didn't have to go."
She went upstairs with the glass and came down again with the baby in
her arms.

     When he had been married to Jean, when indeed he had been married
to Shirley, he had always been able to pay a man to clean the car.
Now he had to do it himself, to stand on the gravel like any
twenty-five pound a week commuter, squelching a Woolworth sponge over
a car that he was ASHAMED to be seen driving into the office
underground car park.  There was, however, one thing about this
morning slopping to be THANKFUL FOR.  Since he was outside he had
been able to catch the postman and take the letters himself.

     He dropped the sponge into the bucket and bent down to polish the
windscreen.  Over the hedge he SAW that his neighbour was opening his
own garage doors, but although he liked the doctor he was in no mood
for conversation that morning.  RESENTMENT CAUGHT AT HIS THROAT LIKE
HEARTBURN.  Greenleaf was wearing another new suit!

Gossip had it that the doctor was awaiting delivery of another new
car.  Oliver could hardly BEAR it when he compared what he THOUGHT of
as the doctor's miserable continental medical degree with his own
Double First.
     "Good morning."

     "Off on your rounds?  What a pity to have to work on a Saturday!
I always tell Oliver he doesn't KNOW his luck, having all the long
week-ends."

     Oliver coughed.  His other wives had LEARNING THAT his coughs
were pregnant with significance.  In Nancy's case there had hardly
been time to teach her, and now...
     "I HOPE I'll see you tonight," said the doctor as he began to
move off.
     "Oh, yes tonight..."  Nancy's face had taken on its former lines
of displeasure.

     "You can't go to a birthday party empty-handed."
     Oliver said weakly.  If only he KNEW for certain.  There might,
after all, be no point in bothering to keep Nancy sweet.

pages 44-49

"...You'll have to nip into Nottingham."
     Disengaging himself, Oliver REFLECTED on his wife's economies.
Now there would be the petrol into Nottingham, at least twelve and six
for chocolates and he's still spent nearly two pounds on Nuit de
Beltane.

     "Come in, Edith."
     "I SEE you've got into out country way of leaving all your doors
unlocked."
     Edith, hot and unwholesome-looking in an aertex shirt and a tweed
skirt, dropped on to the sofa.

From the depths of her shopping basket she produced a wicker handbag
embroidered with flowers.
     "Now, I WANT the opinion of someone young and 'with it'."  Oliver
who was forty-two scowled at her, but Nancy, still in her twenties,
smiled encouragingly.

     "Well, she can't very well sling it back at you," Oliver said
rudely.  "Not in front of everyone."  The mention of Marjorca REMINDED
him of his second wife's demands.  "Excuse me."  He went outside to
get the car.

     "She said it was square," Edith said shortly.  Her children's
failure in achieving the sort of status their parents HAD WANTED FOR
them hurt her bitterly.  Linda-Linda who had been at
Heathfield-working for Mr. Waller; Roger, coming down from Oxford
after a year and going to agricultural college!  She would feed them,
give them beds in her house, but with other people she preferred to
FORGET their existence.
     Nancy said with tactless intuition:  "I thought you weren't
terribly keen on the Selbys.

     "No, but after what Patrick--after him influencing Roger the way
he did, I'm SURPRISED you--well, you know what I mean."
     Nancy floundered.

Their house was no bigger than the Gages'.  But still--you'd only got
to look at Edith to KNOW her brother lived at Chantflower Grange.  I
SUPPOSE she's only going to the party to have a chance to hob-nob with
Crispin Marvell, she THOUGHT.
     "Patrick Selby behaved very badly, very wrongly," Edith said.

"He's perfectly happy and successful in \fIhis\fR job."
     "I never quite KNEW..."

     "He SET OUT to get at my children.  Quite DELIBERATELY, my dear.
Roger was blissfully happy at The House."
     
Patrick Selby got talking to him when he was out with that dog of
theirs and the upshot of it was Roger said his father WANTED his to go
into the business but he wasn't KEEN.  He WANTED to be a farmer.  As
if a boy of nineteen KNOWS what he WANTS.  Patrick said he'd been
forced into business when all he WANTED was to teach or some absurd
thing.  He advised Roger to--well, follow his own INCLINATIONS.  Never
MIND about us, never MIND about poor Paul with no-one to take over the
reins at Gavestons, no heir."
     Nancy, GREEDY FOR gossip, made sympathetic noises.
     "Then, of course, Roger had to say his sister WANTED to earn her
own living.  Made up some stupid tale about out keeping her at home.
The next thing was that impossible interfering man suggested she
should work in a shop till she was old enough to take up nursing.  I
don't KNOW why he did it, unless it was because he LIKES upsetting
people.  Paul had a great deal to say about it, I assure you."

     "But it was no good?"
     "They do what THEY LIKE these days."  She sighed and added
despondently, "But as to going tonight, one has one's neighbourhood,
one cannot pick and choose these days."

"Everyone's respected it except Patrick Selby.  I KNOW for a fact
there were twenty exquisite ancient trees on that plot, and he's had
them all down and planted nasty little willows."
     It was just like Oliver, NANCY THOUGHT, to come in and spoil it
all.
     "If you're looking for your cheque book," she said innocently,
"it's on my record player."

He had spent the early part of the morning washing his china and ever
since he had replaced the cups in the cabinet and the plates on the
walls, he had been unable to keep his eyes from wandering to the
glossy surfaces and the warm rich colours.  It was almost ANNOYING to
REFLECT what he had been missing in delaying this particular bit of
spring-cleaning, the months during which the glaze had been dimmed by
winter bloom.
     For a moment he MUSED over the twin olive-coloured plates, one
decorated with a life-size apple in relief, the other with a peach;
over the Chelsea clock with its tiny dial and opulent figurines of the
sultan and his concubine.  Marvell kept his correspondence behind this
clock and it DISTURBED him to see the corner of Henry Glide's letter
sticking out.  He got up and pushed the envelope out of sight between
the wall and the Circassian's gold-starred trousers.

     "The original building had a clerestory of round-headed windows
with matching windows in the aisle bays.  Only by looking at the
Cistercian abbeys now standing if France can we APPRECIATE the effect
of the..."
     He stopped and sighed.

     "There always were a lot of wasps in Linchester," Marvell said.
"I REMEMBER them in the old days.  Thousands of damned wasps whenever
Mamma gave a garden party." 

Greenleaf looked at him suspiciously.  An Austrian Jew, he could never
ESCAPE HIS CONVICTION that the English landed gentry and the
Corinthian aristocracy came out of the same mould.   

"The wasps are conservative, you see.  They haven't got USED TO THE
IDEA that the old house had been gone five years and a lot of company
directors' Georgian gone up in its place.  They're still on the hunt
for Mamma's brandy snaps.

pages 50-51

     Greenleaf followed him to the house, knocking his head as he
always did on the plaque above the front door that said:  1722.
Andreas Quercus Fecit.  Marvell's reasons for living there were BEYOND
HIS UNDERSTANDING.  The countryside, the flowers, horticulture,
agriculture, Marvell's own brand of viticulture, meant nothing to him.

To invite those disadvantages, positively to court them in the form of
cesspools, muddy lanes and insectivora as his host did, made Marvell a
curio, an object of psychological speculation.
     These mysteries of country life REMINDED him afresh of the cloud
on him morning.
     "I've just lost a patient," he said.  Marvell, pouring whiskey,
heard the Austrian accent coming through, a sign that the doctor was
DISTURBED.  "Not my fault, but still..."

He unhooked the apple plate from the wall and handed it to the doctor.
"Nice?"
     Greenleaf took it WONDERINGLY in short think fingers.  "What's
the good of a thing like this?"

The plate was quite useless.  Distastefully he IMAGINED eating from it
the food he liked best, chopped herring, cucumbers in brine, cabbage
salad with caraway seeds.  Bits would get wedged under the apple
leaves.
     "Its purpose if purely decorative," Marvell laughed.  "Which
REMINDS me, will you be at Tamsin's party?"
     "If I don't get called out."

The movement was youthful and the light dim.  Greenleaf was seldom
DECEIVED about people's ages.  He put Marvell's at between forty-seven
and fifty-two, but the fine lines which the sun showed up were no
longer apparent, and the sprinkling of white hairs was lost in the
fair.  Probably still attractive to women, HE REFLECTED.
     "One party after another," he said.

pages 52-55

     "But she was the favourite?"
     "I don't KNOW about that.  He had already inherited his father's
business so I daresay old Mrs. Selby THOUGHT he didn't need any more."
     "I suppose I do."

Marvell was the only man he knew who could do women's work without
becoming old-womanish.  
     "You know, I don't think she ever really WANTED that house.
Tamsin LOVES old houses and old furniture.  But Patrick insists on
what are called, I BELIEVE, uncluttered lines."
     "Tell me, don't you \fIMIND\fR coming to Linchester?"   Always
fascinated by other people's emotions, Greenleaf had sometimes
wondered about Marvell's reaction to the new houses that had sprung up
on his father's estate.
     Marvell smiled and shrugged.
     "Not really.  I'm devoutly THANKFUL I don't have to keep the old
place up.  Besides it AMUSES me when I go to parties.  I play a sort
of mental game trying to fix just where I am in relation to our
house."  When Greenleaf looked puzzled he went on, "What I mean is,
when I'm at Tamsin's I always THINK TO MYSELF, the ha-ha came down
here and here were the kitchen gardens."  Keeping a straight face he
said, "The Gages' house now, that's where the stables were."

     "You're scaring me.  Makes me WONDER about my own place."
     "Oh, you're all right.  Father's library and a bit of the big
staircase." 
     "I don't BELIEVE a word of it," the doctor said and added a
little shyly, "I'm glad you can make a game of the whole thing."
     "You mustn't THINK," said Marvell, "that every time I set foot on
Linchester I'm wallowing in a kind of maudlin \fIrecherche du temps
perdu\fR."
     Greenleaf was not entirely CONVINCED.  He finished his whisky and
REMEMBERED belatedly his excuse for the visit.
     "And now," he said, at ease on his own home ground, "how's the
hay fever?"

     If the doctor had not perfectly UNDERSTOOD Marvell's Proustian 
reference, he had at least an INKLING of its meaning.  On Edward
Carnaby it would have been UTTERLY LOST.  His French was still at an
elementary stage.

Sex was lacking but freedom and security took its place.  Life was
freer with Free, he thought, PLEASED with his pun.
     "If you and Cheryl WANT your lunch on time you'll have to do
something about these wasps, Ted."  She marched in, brisk, neat,
womanly, in a cotton frock and frilled apron.  He NOTED WITH PLEASURE
that she had said lunch and not dinner.  Linchester was educating
Freda.

"...To shine, to glow, emit a radiance.  THE VERB PERFECTLY EXPRESSED
HIS OWN MENTAL STATE.  He was GLOWING WITH SATISFACTION AND
ANTICIPATION.  \fIEdouard brille\fR, HE SAID TO HIMSELF, chuckling
aloud.  "I've promised to pass the stuff on to some people."
     "What people?"
     "The gorgeous Mrs. Selby, if you MUST KNOW.  I met her last night
and she was all over me."

     "There's no need to get into a tiz.  She said I could bring a
friend.  I DON'T KNOW about Cheryl, though."
     "Mrs. Saxton'll sit," Freda said eagerly.  "She's always
offering."  Seeing his FACE STILL DOUBTFUL, his eyes already returning
to the French primer, she burst out miserably, "Ted, I WANT to go to
the party!  I've got a right.  I've got more right than you."
     HYSTERIA IN FREDA was something new.  He closed the book.
     "What are you talking about?"  She was his twin and he COULD FEEL
THE PULL OF HER MIND, ALMOST READ HER THOUGHTS.  A TERRIBLE UNEASE
VISITED HIM and he THOUGHT of the previous night, the woman's eyes
starring past him towards the pond, her sudden unexplained coldness
when he had said who he was.
     "Freda!"
     It all came out then and Edward listened, angry and afraid.  The
HAPPY MOOD AND GONE SOUR on him.

pages 56-61

To his wife he said nothing, but his look meant Please don't interfere
with my arrangements.  When the tools were put away and the dusters
carefully washed, he had taken the dog to Sherwood Forest, smug,
silent with his PRIVATE JOY.
     It was too late not to bother with a show of loving obedience.
Tamsin dressed, WISHING she had something bright and gay, but all her
clothes were subdued--to please Patrick.  Then she went into the
dining room and helped herself to whisky, pouring straight into a
tumbler almost as if it was the last drink she would ever have.
Nobody had WISHED her a happy birthday yet but she had had plenty of
cards.  Defiantly she took them from the sideboard drawer and arranged
them on top of the radiator.

There were about a dozen of them, facetious ones showing dishevelled
housewives amid piles of crocks; conventional ones (a family of
Dartmoor ponies); one whose picture had a secret significance, whose
message meant something special to her and to its sender.  It was
unsigned but Tamsin KNEW who had sent it.  She screwed it up quickly
for the sight of it with its cool presumption only DEEPENED HER
MISERY.
     "Many happy returns of the day, Tamsin," she said shakily,
raising her glass.  She sighed and the cards fluttered.  Somehow she
WOULD HAVE LIKED to break the glass, hurl it absurdly against
Patrick's white wall, because she had come to an end.  A new life was
beginning.  

Patrick was careful about propriety.
     Tamsin remained in the dining room for some minutes, FEELING an
almost suicidal DESPAIR.  In an hour or so her guests would begin to
arrive and they would EXPECT her to be gay because she was young and
rich and beautiful and because it was her birthday.  If she could get
out of the house for a few minutes she might feel better.

The dog lay down in the sun and Tamsin began stripping the bushes of
their ripe white fruit.
     "I will try to be gay," SHE SAID TO HERSELF, or perhaps to the
dog, "for a little while."
     Edward and Freda came up to the front doors of Hallows at a
quarter to eight and it was Edward who rang the bell.  Freda, whose
only reading matter was her weekly women's magazine, had sometimes
encountered the cliche 'rooted to the spot' and that was how SHE FELT
standing on the swept white stones, immobile, stiff with terror, a
sick bile stirring between her stomach and her throat.
     No one came to the door.

They walked round the side of the house and stopped when they
came to the patio.  The  GARDEN lay before them, waiting, EXPECTANT,
but not for the arrival of some photographer whose carefully angled
shots would provide pictures for one of those very magazines. 

At the other end of the patio someone had arranged tables and chairs,
some of straw-coloured wicker, others of white-painted twisted metal.
A SMALL SPARK OF PLEASURE AND ADMIRATION BROKE ACROSS FREDA'S FEAR,
ONLY TO BE EXTINGUISHED almost at once by the sound of water gurgling
down a drainpipe behind her ankles.  A sign of life, of habitation.
     The garden, the house, looked, she THOUGHT, as if it hadn't been
kept outside at all, as it if had been preserved up to this moment
under glass.  But she was unable to express THIS THOUGHT in words and
instead said foolishly:
     "There isn't anybody about.  You must have got the wrong night."
     He scowled and she WONDERED again why he had come, what he was
going to say or do.  Was it simply kindness to her--for he was, as it
were, her key to this house--Tamsin's fascination or something more?

     Minutes passed, unchanging minutes in which the sleek garden swam
before her eyes.  Then something happened, something which caused the
first CRACK to appear in Edward's insecure COURAGE.
     From behind the willows came a sound familiar to Freda, a long
drawn-out bay.

     The dog advanced, wriggling now, to lick the out-stretched
fingers, when the gate opened and a tall fair man entered the garden.
He was wearing a green shirt over slacks and Edward at once FELT THAT
his own sports jacket (Harris tweed knocked down to eighty nine and
eleven) was unsuitable, an anachronism.
     "How do you do?"

The roses were perfect, each bud closed yet about to unfurl, and their
stems had been shorn of thorns.
     "I don't THINK we've met.  My name's Marvell."

     "Where is everyone?"
     "We don't KNOW," Freda said sullenly.  "Till you came we THOUGHT
we'd got the wrong night."

pages 62-67

"Tamsin dear, I'm keeping you from your guests."
     Afterwards, looking back, Freda THOUGHT Tamsin honestly hadn't
KNOWN why they were.  And after all Edward's stupid airs!..."

She stood looking at them still holding a rose against her paintless
lips.  At last she said:
     "I KNOW!  The man who goes to evening class."
     Freda WANTED to go then, to slink back against the stone wall,
slither between the house and the wattle fence and then run and run
until she came to the chalets behind the elms.  But Edward was holding
her arm.

     Tamsin's face hardened.  It was exactly like one of those African
art masks, Freda THOUGHT, the beautiful goddess one in the saloon bar
of that roadhouse on the Southwell road.  Freda KNEW she wasn't going
to shake hands.
     "Well, now you're here you must have a drink."

And she linked her arm into his, smiling brightly.
     Freda could FEEL herself beginning to tremble.  She KNEW her face
had paled, then filled with burning blood.  Her hand fumbled its way
into Patrick's, gaining life and strength as she felt the faint
special pressure and the familiar cold touch of his ring.

     Patrick picked up the Vesprid and looked at the label.
     Freda couldn't help ADMIRING his aplomb, the coldly masterful way
he shook off Tamsin's hand.
     "Doesn't it look horrible on my birthday table?"

"There.  You look after it, sweetie, or pop it in a safe place.  We
don't WANT it mingling with the drinks, do we?"
     Then Marvell rescued them and took them into the dining room.

"You're a very handsome mature man.  Who WANTS to be a teenager?"
     "Not me, unless you can be one too."

"I was just saying to Joan, is there a doctor in the house?"
     "Ha, ha," said Greenleaf mechanically.  "I HOPE noone's going to
need one.  I've come to enjoy myself."

"...And I've just been telling Nancy how lovely she smells.  IMAGINE,
she's wearing it herself.  You're all so good to me."

     She sniffed.  "Much too square for Linda."
     "I SUPPOSE so."
     Tamsin had gone, swept away in the arms of Oliver Gage.

     "Not now, Denholm."  Patrick's smile was brief, mechanical, gone
in a flash.  "I don't CARE to mix business with pleasure."
     "Later then?"
     Patrick glanced at the ashtray Smith-King was filling with stubs,
opened the cigarette box insolently and let the lid fall almost
instantly.
     "I'm not SURPRISED you've got a lump," he said, "but don't bore
my guests, will you?"
     "Funny chap," Smith-King said and an uneasy flush seeped across
his face.  "Doesn't CARE what he says."  The red faded as Patrick
strolled away.  "Now about this said lump..."
     Greenleaf turned towards him and tried to look as if he was
listening while KEEPING HIS THOUGHTS AND HALF AN EYE on the other
guests.
     Most of them were his patients except the Selbys and the
Gavestons who were on Dr. Howard's private list, but he SIZED them up
now from a psychological rather than a medical STANDPOINT.  As he
sometimes said to Bernice, he had to KNOW about human nature, it was
part of his job.
     The Carnabys now, they weren't enjoying themselves.
 
     Beyond them among the currants bushes Marvell was showing Joan
and Nancy the ancient glories of the Manor kitchen gardens.  Greenleaf
KNEW little about women's fashions but Nancy's dress LOOKED out of
place to him, ill-fitting (she'll have to watch her weight, said the
medical part of him, or her blood pressure will go soaring up in ten
years' time).  It contrasted badly with the expensive scent she wore,
whiffs of which he had caught while they were standing together by
Tamsin's birthday table.

Clare and Walter Miller lumbered past him, resolutely foxtrotting out
of time.  Rather AGAINST HER WILL Bernice had been coaxed into the
arms of Old Paul Gaveston who, to CONSCIOUS of the proprieties to hold
her close, stared poker-faced over her shoulder, his embracing hand a
good two inches from her back.  Greenleaf SMILED TO HIMSELF.  Gage was
without such inhibitions.  

     "The thing is," Smith-King was saying, "it's getting bigger.  NO
GETTING AWAY FROM it."
     "I'd better take a look at it."  Greenleaf said.
     
     A fourth couple had joined the dancers.  Greenleaf felt RELIEVED.
Patrick was a difficult fellow at the best of times but he could rise
to an occasion.  It was NICE to see him rescuing the Carnaby girl and
dancing with her as if he really WANTED to.
     "You will?"  Smith-King half-rose.

pages 68-70

With little yelps of delight Nancy ran up and down, pointing and
exhorting the others to come and have a closer look.
     "So GLAD you like them," Tamsin said.  "We do."  Patrick coughed,
dissociating himself.  He was TAKING HIS DUTIES TO HEART, Greenleaf
thought, watching his hand enclose Freda Carnaby's in a tight grip.
     "Now, have we all got drinks?"

     "Oh, but we've got some.  I'll get it."
     "No, I'll go.  You WANT to dance."
     Gabe had already claimed her, his arm about her waist.

     "Oh, do you have two bathrooms?  How grand!"
     "Just through the spare room," Tamsin said, IGNORING her.
     "You KNOW the way.'
     The expression in her eyes shocked Greenleaf.  It was as if, HE
THOUGHT, she was playing some dangerous game.
     "I'm being absurd," he said to Bernice.

"You might have warned me."
     "What \fIdo\fR you MEAN, chamber of horrors?"  Nancy was
wide-eyed.

"Come see the skeleton in the cupboard!"
     They began to file out into the hall, the women giggling
EXPECTANTLY.  Marvell went first, his drink in his hand.

pages 71-79

     "Definitely not my cup of tea," Nancy said.  "IMAGINE FORGETTING
it was there and then coming face to face with it in the night on your
way to the loo!"
     Greenleaf was suddenly sickened.

     It was a large picture, an oil painting in a frame of scratched
gilt, and it stood propped on the floor against the watered silk
wallpaper.  Greenleaf KNEW nothing at all about painting and the VIEW
many people take that all life--or all death--is a fit subject for art
would have APPALLED him.  Or brushwork, of colour, he was IGNORANT,
but he KNEW a good deal about anatomy and a fair amount about sexual
perversion.  Therefore he was able to admire the artist for his
accuracy--the hewn neck on the silver platter showed the correct
vertebra and the jugular in its proper place--and deplore a MENTALITY
which thought sadism a suitable subject for entertainment.  Greenleaf
hated cruelty; all the suffering of all his ancestors in the ghettos
of Eastern Europe WAS STRONG WITHIN him.  He stuck out his thick
underlip, took off his glasses and began polishing them on his alpaca
jacket.

     "But just look at the awful way she's staring at that ghastly
head," Nancy cried, clutching Oliver's hand.  "I THINK I ought to
UNDERSTAND what it means, but I don't"
     "Perhaps it's just as well," her husband said crisply.
     "What is it, Tamsin?  What's it SUPPOSED to be?"
     Tamsin had drawn her fingers across the think painted surface,
letting a nail rest at the pool of blood.

"Who painted it, Tamsin?"
     "I just wouldn't KNOW," Tamsin shrugged.  "It was my
grandmother's.  I lived with her, YOU SEE, and I grew up with it, so
it doesn't affect me all that much any more.  I used to love it when I
was a little girl."

     "You're never going to hang it on the wall?" Clare Miller asked.
     "I might.  I don't KNOW yet.  When my grandmother died two years
ago she left all her furniture to a friend, a Mrs. Prynne."

     "That's the ticket."  He slapped Marvell on the back.
     Patrick seemed to REALISE that his hand was still resting in
Tamsin's.  He snatched it away, marched out of the room and down the
stairs, his dignity returning.  

Her eyes were very bright.  She linked her arm into Oliver's and as an
AFTERTHOUGHT clasped Nancy's hand and swung it.  "Eat, drink, and be
merry for tomorrow we die!"

She pulled her chair up alongside Greenleaf's.  "I THOUGHT Patrick
made an exhibition of himself, didn't you?  Immature I call it, making
all that fuss about a picture."

     "Juvenile," Nancy said.  "I mean, it's not as if it was a film.
I don't MIND admitting I've seen some horror films that have
absolutely terrified me.  I've wakened in the night bathed in
perspiration, haven't I, Oliver?"

"You would do it."  Since he had been the first to do so, Greenleaf
THOUGHT, was hardly fair.  "I hate this damned inefficiency."

"You've got a nest, you know."
     "That doesn't SURPRISE me at all," said Walter Miller who lived
next door.  "I said to Clare only yesterday, you mark my words, I
said, the Selbys have got a wasp nest in their roof."

     "You'd better nip up to the spare bedroom," he said to Patrick
importantly.  "I RECKON the nest's just above the bathroom window."
     "What for?" Patrick had paled and Greenleaf THOUGHT he knew why.
     "I shall WANT some more light, shan't I?" Edward was enjoying
himself.

He was staring at the figure on the ladder and his narrow red lips
were wet.  Greenleaf SAW THAT he was clenching and unclenching his
hands.
     "Oh, look! What's happening?"

pages 80-87

In the rainbow glimmer they stood silent and peering like a crowd at a
bullfight who have seen a hated matador come to grief.  The HOSTILITY
WAS ALMOST TANGIBLE and there was no sound but the steady buzz of the
wasps.
     "Come along."  Greenleaf heard his own voice pealing like a bell.

     "Get lost!"
     "Please don't quarrel."  No one KNEW how freda had insinuated
herself into her position on the footstool at Patrick's knees, nor
exactly when she had taken his hand.  "It's bad enough as it is."

"Excuse me, will you?  It might be a GOOD IDEA for my husband to
get some air."
     For the second time that night Denholm Smith-King looked first at
his watch, then at his wife.  "Well, we'll be getting along.  You
won't WANT us."
     Marvell had come in with the coffee things but Tamsin didn't
argue.

"Have you got any bi-carb?  It's wonderful for wasp sting. I
REMEMBERED when my sister..."
     "Come \fIalong\fR, Nancy," Oliver said.

It looked as if he was going to leave without another word, but he
stopped at the door and took Tamsin's hand.  Their eyes met, Tamsin's
wary, his, unless Greenleaf was IMAGINING things, full of pleading
disappointment.  Then when Nancy kissed her, he followed suit,
touching her cheek with a sexless peck that was common politeness in
Linchester.

She just looked annoyed.
     "I don't THINK so."  Howard, he KNEW for a fact, wasn't on the
week-end rota.  A substitute would come and--who COULD TELL?-- that
substitute might be himself.  "There's not much you can do."

Tamsin had left the front doors open for him and as he crossed the
hall he heard no voices.  They were all sitting in silence, each
apparently NURSING PRIVATE RESENTMENT.  Freda had moved a little away
from Patrick and had helped herself to coffee.

"When you've quite finished, of course."
     "I'M SURE I didn't MEAN to be \fIde trop\fR."  Edward blushed but
he brought out his painfully acquired French defiantly.

     "Night," Patrick said abruptly.  He pushed past Edward, ignoring
the muttered "We know when we're not WANTED."  At the door he said to
Greenleaf, "You'll come up?" and the doctor nodded.

The cheek had swollen and closed the eye.  He looked, GREENLEAF
THOUGHT, rather as if he had mumps.
     Queenie was stretched beside him, her feet at the foot of the
bed, her jowls within the palm of him hand.

There were no curtains here to sway and alarm a sleeper, only the
white hygienic blinds.
     "Do you WANT something to make you sleep?"  Prudently Greenleaf
had brought his bag back with him.

From the woods between Linchester and Marvell's house something cried
out, a fox perhaps or just an owl.  It could have been either for all
Greenleaf KNEW.  His short stocky body cast a long shadow in the
moonlight as he crossed The Green to the house called Shalom.

He held the lamp for a moment against the mezzotint of Rievaulx.  It
RECALLED to him his own work on another Cistercian abbey and, setting
the lamp by the window, he sat down with his manuscript, not to
write--it was too late for that--but to read what he had written that
day.
     Red and white by the window.

The snowflake fronds of the Russian Vine and beside it hanging like
drops of crimson wax, Berberidopis, blood-red, absurdly named.  The
moonlight and the lamplight met and something seemed to PIERCE HIS
HEART.
     Moths seeing the light, came at once to the lattice and a
coal-black one--Marvell RECOGNISED it as The Chimney Sweeper's
Boy--fluttered in at the open casement.  It was followed by a larger,
greyish-white one, its wings hung with filaments, swans-down in
miniature.  

For a second Marvell watched them seek the lamp.  Then, FEARFUL least
they burn their wings, he gathered them up, making a loose cage of his
hands, and thrust them out of the window.
     They spiralled away from yellow into silvery light.

     It was unlikely that anyone would call him out today.  He had
done his Sunday stint on the Chantflower doctors' rota, the previous
week-end, and he INTENDED to have a lazy day.  Bernice appeared at
about ten and they had a leisurely breakfast, talking about the boys
and about the new car which ought to arrive in time to fetch them home
for the holidays.

pages 88-94

They were near enough to the house to hear the phone but when it rang
Greenleaf let Bernice answer it, KNOWING it wouldn't be for him.
     But instead of settling down to a good gossip Bernice came back
quickly, looking puzzled.  This was odd, for Bernice seldom hurried.
     "It's Tamsin, darling," she said.  "She WANTS you."
     "Me?"
     "She's in a state, but she wouldn't tell me anything.  All she
said was I WANT Max."
     Greenleaf took the call on the morning room phone.

For almost the first time since he had met her Tamsin wasn't using her
affected drawl.  "I KNOW I shouldn't be ringing you about this but I
can't get hold of Dr. Howard."  She paused and he heard her inhale as
if on a cigarette.

In pain from his stings Patrick had taken an extra one of the
capsules.  I ought to have taken the damned things away with me,
Greenleaf SAID TO HIMSELF.  But still, it wasn't for him to baby
another man's patients.

She looked alarmed and because of her fear, very young. 
     "Oh, Max, I DIDN'T KNOW what to do."
     "Still asleep, is he?"

Greenleaf know that colour, the yellowish ivory of parchment, and that
waxen texture.
     He took one of the wrists and REMEMBERED what Tamsin had said
about the heavy feeling.  Then, having slipped one hand under the
bedclothes, he lifted Patrick's eyelids and closed them again.  

Feeling Patrick's pulse and heart had been just a farce.  He had KNOWN
when he came into the room.  The dead look so very dead, as if they
have never been alive.

One of the beds had been slept in and the covers were thrown back.
"Would YOU LIKE TO sit down?"
     "Can't you wake his either?"
     "I'm AFRAID ..." He was a friend and he put his arm about her
shoulders.  "You must be prepared for a shock."  She looked up at him.
He had never NOTICED how large her eyes were nor of what a curious
shade of transparent amber.  "I'm very MUCH AFRAID Patrick is dead."
     She neither cried nor cried out.

Resting back against the bed-head, she remained as still as if she too
were dead.  She seemed to be THINKING.  It was as if, Greenleaf
THOUGHT, all her past life with Patrick was being re-lived momentarily
within her brain.  At last she shuddered and bowed her head.

     Greenleaf shook his head.
     "I don't WANT to trouble you now," he said gently, "but those
capsules, the sodium amytal, where are they?"
     Tamsin got up like a woman in a dream.

     He followed her back into the other bedroom.  She looked at
Patrick, still without crying, and Greenleaf EXPECTED her to kiss the
pallid forehead.  They usually did.

     "There are still five in the bottle," she said, and held it out
to him.  Greenleaf was VERY SURPRISED.  He FELT A CREEPING UNEASE.
     "I'll get on to Dr. Howard," he said.

     She had stopped crying.  "Oh, yes," she said.
     "It doesn't matter.  I don't WANT to upset you."
     "That's all right, Max.  I'd LIKE to talk about it."
     "You didn't sleep in the same room?"
     "Not when one of us was ill," Tamsin said quickly.  "I THOUGHT if
he were restless it would be better for me to go in the back.
Restless!"

"He was sleeping then.  I KNOW he was, he was breathing.  Well, and
I didn't wake up till eleven."

"I couldn't wake him so I phoned Dr. Howard.  You KNOW the rest."
     Patrick had died, Greenleaf THOUGHT, as he had lived, precisely,
tidily, without dirt or disorder.  Not for him the sloppy squalor that
attended so many death-beds.

     "Oh, no.  No, I KNOW we haven't.  Patrick just had those six left
and I never need anything to make me sleep."

     "I don't think so.  We'd been married for seven years, you know,
but I've KNOWN Patrick since he was a little boy.  I don't KNOW if you
KNEW we were cousins?  His father and mine were brothers."

They used to make him wrap up warm even in the summer and I had
swimming lessons but they wouldn't let him.  I always THOUGHT it was
because they'd lived in California." She paused, frowning. "He was
always all right when he was grown-up.  The only time he went to Dr.
Howard was when he couldn't sleep."
     "I THINK you will have to prepare yourself," Greenleaf said, "for
the possibility of an inquest, or, at any rate, a post-mortem."
     She nodded earnestly.
     "Oh, quite," she said.  "I UNDERSTAND.  That'll be absolutely all
right."

     As things turned out, it never came to an inquest.  Greenleaf
stood in at the post-mortem because he was INTERESTED and because the
Selbys had been friends of his.  Patrick had died, like all the dead,
of heart failure.

Freda Carnaby tore herself from Mrs. Saxton's arm and, sobbing loudly,
fell to her knees beside the dark cavity.  As he said afterwards to
Greenleaf, Marvell THOUGHT that like Hamlet she was going to leap into
the grave.  But nothing dramatic happened.

pages 97-106

With four empty houses on Linchester Nancy was bored to tears.  When
Oliver came home for the week-ends, tired and uneasy, he FOUND his
evening programmes mapped out for him.
     Tonight the Greenleafs and Crispin Marvell were invited for
coffee and drinks.  Opening his sideboard, Oliver FOUND that Nancy had
laid in a stock of cheap Cyprus sherry and bottles of cocktails as
variously coloured as the liquid that used to be displayed in the
flagons of old-fashioned pharmacy windows.  He cursed, CLINGING TO THE
SHREDS OF HIS PRIDE and REMEMBERING the days that were gone.
     The mantelpiece was decorated with postcards.

These visits of Linda's, ostensibly made to deliver Nancy's order of
tablets of soap or a packet of Kleenex, always put him in a bad
temper.  They invariably led to petulance on Nancy's part, to
DISSATISFACTION and a carping ENVY.  It AMAZED Oliver that a village
chemist like Waller could stock such an immense and catholic variety
of luxury goods, all of which at some time or another seemed so
DESIRABLE to his wife and at the same time so conducive to the saving
of money.  The latest in Thermos flasks, automatic tea-makers,
thermostatically controlled electric blankets, shower cabinets, all
these had in the year they had lived in Linchester, been recommended
to Nancy and COVETED by her.
     "It would be such a saving in the long run," she would say
wistfully of some gimmick, using the suburban colloquialisms Oliver
hated.
     Moreover it was SURPRISING that behind Waller's counter there
stood concealed the most expensive ranges of cosmetics from Paris and
New York, scent and creams which were apparently exclusive to him and
not to be found in Nottingham or, for that matter, London.  He was
therefore pleasantly astonished when the door had closed on Linda to
see Nancy come dancing into the room, contented, gay and in a strange
way, gleeful.
     "WHAT'S GOT INTO YOU?"
     "Nothing."

     "Linda told me something very peculiar."
     "Really?" he said.  "SURPRISE me."
     She pouted.

For a moment, a transient moment, she looked just as she had when he
had first seen her dancing with the man she had been engaged to.  It
had been such fun stealing her from him, especially PIQUANT because
the fiance had also been Shirley's cousin.  "Nasty Oliver!  I shall
save it all up till the Greenleafs get here."
     "I can see," said Oliver in his best co-respondent's voice, "I
can SEE I shall have to be very nice to you."
     "Very, very nice," said Nancy.

"...It must be the country air."  But she didn't say anything after
that and presently Oliver FORGOT all about Linda Gaveston.  
     When Marvell rang the door-bell she didn't bother to tidy her
hair or put on fresh make-up.

Suddenly Oliver felt odd.  Her naivete EMBARRASSED him.  He went to
dispense drinks from his own stock, leaving the bright mean bottles in
the sideboard.

Oliver fancied that Marvell was looking at his quizzically.
     "I don't SUPPOSE she FEELS LIKE writing."  Bernice was always
kind and forbearing.

And he began to talk about his own holiday, planned for September this
year, and to ask about the Gages'.
     Holidays were a sore point with Oliver who HOPED to do without
one altogether.  He need not have WORRIED.  Nancy was obviously not
going to let the subject go as easily as that.
     "Poor Tamsin," she said loudly, drowning the doctor's voice.
"FANCY being a widow when you're only twenty-seven."
     "Dreadful," said Bernice.
     "And in such--well, awkward circumstances."
     "Awkward circumstance?" said Greenleaf, DRAWN UNWILLINGLY FROM
HIS DREAMS of the Riviera.
     "I don't mean money-wise."  Oliver winced but Nancy went on: "The
whole thing was so funny, Patrick dying like that.  I EXPECT you'll
all THINK I've got a very SUSPICIOUS MIND but I can't help THINKING it
was..."  She paused for effect and sipped her gin. "Well, it was
fishy, wasn't it?"

He bent down and straightened it.
     "I don't KNOW if I ought to say this," Nancy went on.  "I don't
SUPPOSE it's common KNOWLEDGE, but Patrick's father..." She lowered
her voice.  "Patrick's father committed suicide."

     "Oh, dear," said Bernice comfortably.
     "I really don't KNOW who it was told me," Nancy said.  She picked
up the plate of canapes and handed it to Marvell.  To his shame Oliver
SAW THAT only half a cocktail onion topped the salmon mayonnaise on
each of them.

     "Of course it was.  And Tamsin told you.  I can't IMAGINE why."
     All childish innocence, she looked archly from face to face.
     Marvell said:  "I'm AFRAID I'm being obtuse, but I can't quite
SEE what Patrick's father's suicide had to do with his son dying of
heart failure."
     "Oh, absolutely nothing."

He could cheerfully have slapped Nancy's face.  "I THINK we're boring
our guests," he said, bracketing himself with his wife and trying to
make his voice sound easy. "Another drink, Max?"

"No I won't shut up, Oliver.  I'm only repeating it because I'd be
VERY INTERESTED in having an opinion from a medical man.  You KNOW
that funny little man who's a commercial traveller?  The one who lives
in the chalets?"

     "That's right, Carnaby.  The one who was so difficult at the
party.  Well, the day before Patrick died he came into Waller's shop
and what d'you THING he tried to buy?"  She waited for the guesses
that never came.

"Elsewhere," she said with sinister emphasis.  "Now why did he WANT
it?"
     "Probably for killing wasps," said Marvel.

     "Linda overheard the conversation," she said, "and that's just
what this fellow Carnaby said.  He said he WANTED it for wasps.  Linda
thought it was pretty thin."

     "Linda Gaveston is a stupid little trouble-maker," he said
furiously.
     "I SUPPOSE that goes for me too?"
     "I didn't say so," said Oliver, TOO ANGRY TO CARE.  "But if the
cap fits...I hate all this under-hand gossip."

"On the other hand, perhaps you'd better not.  I don't WANT to pay out
whacking damages for slander."
     "It won't go any further.  Anyway, it's my duty as a citizen to
say what I think.  Everyone KNOWS Edward Carnaby had a terrific motive
for getting Patrick out of the way."
     There was an APPALLED silence.  Nancy had grown red in the face
and her plump breasts rose and fell under the clinging pink wool.
     "You're all crazy about Tamsin.  I KNOW that.  But Patrick
wasn't."

"It was just a horrid sordid little intrigue."
     As much as Oliver, Greenleaf WANTED to stop her.  He was
immeasurably grateful for Bernice's rich cleansing laughter.

"It means a lot, being twins.  He wouldn't WANT to lose her.
Patrick might have gone off with her."

Oliver had moved over to the record player and the red glaze had left
his face.
     "Well, what does Max THINK?" Nancy asked.
     How wise Bernice had been, laughing easily, refusing to catch his
eye!  Greenleaf didn't really WANT to do a Smith-King and flee at the
scent of trouble.  Besides, Oliver had some good records, Bartok and
the wonderful Donizetti he wanted to hear again. 
     "You KNOW," he said in a quiet gentle voice, "it's AMAZING the
way people EXPECT the worst when a young person dies suddenly.  They
always WANT to make a mystery."  he wondered if Bernice and, for that
matter Marvell, noticed how dismay was evoking his guttural accent.

     "I can assure you Patrick didn't die of cyanide.  You SEE, of all
the poisons commonly used in cases of homicide cyanide is the most
easily detected.  The smell, for one thing..."

     "That among other things.  BELIEVE me, it's fantastic to talk of
cyanide."  His hands moved expressively. "No please," he said.
     "Well, what do you REALLY THINK, then?"
     "I THINK you're a very pretty girl with a VIVID IMAGINATION and
Linda Gaveston watches too much television.  I WONDER if I might have
some more of your excellent whisky, Oliver?"
     Oliver took the glass gratefully.

     The sound of the rain falling steadily had formed throughout the
conversation a monotonous background chorus.  Now, as they became
silent, the music of The Faithful Shepherd Suite filled the room.
Greenleaf listened to the orchestra and NOTED the repetition of each
phrase with the appreciation of the scientist:  but Marvell, with the
ear of the artist \fImanque\fR, felt the absurd skimped room
transformed about him and, SIGHING WITHIN HIMSELF for something
irrevocably lost, SAW a green grove as in a Constable landscape and
beneath the leaves a lover with the Pipes of Pan.

pages 107-115

     "It's no good quoting me," said the doctor.  "You KNOW I never
read anything but the B.M.F." He drew a deep breath, savouring the
night air.  "Very nice," he said inadequately.  "I'M GLAD I summoned
up the energy to walk back with you."
     "It was a sticky evening, wasn't it?" Marvell went first, holding
back brambles for Greenleaf to pass along the path.

     "Silly little woman," Greenleaf said, harshly for him.  "I HOPE
Gage can stop her gossiping."
     "It could be awkward ."

     Then suddenly, "May I ask you something?" he said.  "I don't WANT
to offend you."
     "You won't do that."
     "You're a doctor, but Patrick wasn't your patient."  Marvell
spoke quietly.  "I asked you if I would offend you because I was
THINKING of medical etiquette.  But-look, I'm not scandal mongering
like Nancy Gage-weren't you VERY SURPRISED when Patrick died like
that?"
     Greenleaf said guardedly, "I was SURPRISED, yes."
     "THUNDERSTRUCK?"
     "Like that poor fellow on the golf course?  Well, no.  You see a
lot of strange things in my job.  I THOUGHT at first Patrick had taken
an overdose of sodium amytal.  I'd given him an anti-histamine, two
hundred milligrammes Phenergan, and one would potentiate..." He
stopped, LOATH to give these esoteric details to a layman. "He had the
sodium amytal and I advised him to take one."

     "The first thing?" Marvell asked.  "You MEAN, you looked for
other things?  You SUSPECTED suicide or even murder?"
     "No, no, no" Greenleaf said impatiently. "A man had died, a
young, apparently healthy man.  Glover had to FIND OUT what he died
of.  Patrick died of heart failure."

The kitchen smelt of herbs and wine.  Greenleaf THOUGHT he could
detect another less pleasant scent.  Mildew.

"Glover made some enquires at Patrick's old school.  Tamsin didn't
KNOW anything and Patrick's parents were dead.  He'd never complained
to Howard about feeling ill..."

     "May I ask if you got anything from the school?"
     "I don't KNOW if you may," Greenleaf said severely.  "I don't
KNOW why you WANT to KNOW.  but if there's going to be a lot of
talk...Glover wrote to the headmaster and he got a letter back saying
Patrick had had to be let off some of the games because he'd had
rheumatic fever."

pages 110-117

She's one of these old women with a good memory.  She REMEMBERED
Patrick had had rheumatic fever when he was three-very early to have
it, incidentally-and that the name of his doctor had been Goldstein."
     Marvell was embarrassed.

It was rather cold.
    Then Marvell said: "I was CURIOUS about Patrick." He sat down and
warmed his hands at the lamp.  Greenleaf WONDERED if Bernice, at home
in Shalom, had turned on the central heating.  "Perhaps I have a
SUSPICIOUS MIND.  Patrick had a good many enemies, you KNOW.  Quite a
lot of people must be GLAD he's dead."
     "And I have a LOGICAL MIND," said Greenleaf briskly.

"Patrick Selby dies suddenly.  Therefore, she REASONS, Patrick died
of cyanide.  But we \fIKNOW\fR Patrick didn't die of cyanide.  He died
a natural death.  Can't you SEE that once your original premise falls
to the ground there's no longer any reason to DOUBT it?  No matter how
much Carnaby hated him-if he did, which I doubt-no matter if he
succeeded in buying a ton of cyanide, he didn't kill Patrick with it
because one person appears to have a thin motive and access-possible
access-to means \fIthat were never used at all\fR, you start reasoning
that he was in fact murdered, that half a dozen people had motives and
that one of them succeeded."

"That's a matter for the coroner."
     "No DOUBT he know his own business."
     "You don't have inquests on people who die naturally."

     But Marvell didn't come and Greenleaf saw nothing of him for
several days.  Greenleaf began to THINK that he would hear no more of
Patrick's death-until surgery time Wednesday morning.
     The first patient to come into the consulting room through the
green baize door was Denholm Smith-King.  He was on his way to his
Nottingham factory and at last he had SUMMONED the courage to let
Greenleaf examine him.
     "It's nothing," the doctor said as Smith-King sat up on the couch
buttoning his shirt.

     "Quite the detective in your own way, aren't you?" Greenleaf had
only noticed that the sepia stains had paled to yellow and this remark
REMINDED him of things he wanted to forget.  "Yes, I've cut it down,"
Smith-King said and he gave the doctor a heavy, though friendly buffet
on the back.  "You quacks, you don't KNOW the strains a business man
has to contend with.  You don't KNOW you're born," but his hearty
laugh softened the words.
     "Things going better, are they?"

Then, just as he was picking up his ignition key, the baize door was
pushed feebly open and Freda Carnaby shuffled in wearily like an old
woman.
     He was SHOCKED at the change in her.  IMPATIENCE DIED as he
offered her a chair and sat down himself.  What had become of the
bright birdlike creature with the practical starched cotton dresses
and the impractical shoes?

     "I can't sleep.  I haven't had a proper night's sleep since I
don't KNOW how long." She felt in the pocket of the mock suede jacket
she wore over her crumpled print dress.

"He died quite recently."
     "I'm sorry to hear that." Greenleaf began to WONDER what was
coming.
     "I don't KNOW what to do."
     He had OBSERVED before that it is this particular phrase that
triggers off the tears, the breakdown.  It may be true, it may be
felt, but it is only when it is actually uttered aloud that its full
signifcance, the complete helpless disorientation it implies, BRINGS
HOME to the speaker the wretchedness of his or her plight.
     "Now you mustn't say that," he said, KNOWING his inadequacy.
"Time does heal, you KNOW."  The healer passing the buck, he THOUGHT.
"I'll let you have something to make you sleep."

"Help a-a broken heart?  Oh, Doctor, I don't KNOW what to do.  I don't
know what to do."

     Greenleaf went to the sink and drew her a glass of water.
     "I'd  LIKE to tell you about it." She sipped and wiped her eyes.
"Can I tell you about it?"

     "It was Patrick Selby.  You KNEW that didn't you?" Greenleaf said
nothing so she went on.

When she said out of the blue, "We were going to get married," he
jumped.
     "I KNOW what you're going to say.  You're going to say he was
already married."

     But she rushed on, the words tumbling out.
     "She was having an affair with that awful man Gage.  Patrick KNEW
all about it.  She used to meet him in London during the week.
PATRICK knew.  She said she was going to see some old friend of her
grandmother's, but half the time she was with that man."
     SYMPATHY FOUGHT with and FINALLY CONQUERED Greenleaf's distaste.
Keeping his expression a kindly blank, he began to fold up the
prescription.
     Misinterpreting his look, she said defensively:
     "I KNOW what you're THINKING.  But I wasn't carrying on with
Patrick."

How stem the tide of appalling revelation?
     "And the terrible thing is I KNOW he was killed.  That's why I
can't sleep.  And I KNOW who killed him."
     This was too much.

"...This is certain.  I KNOW it.  You'll do your brother and yourself
a lot of harm if you go about saying things you can't substantiate."
     "\fISubstantiate\fR?" She stumbled over the word.  "I can
\fIPROVE\fR it.  You REMEMBER what it was like at that awful party.
Well, Oliver Gage went back by himself when it was all over."

"He was carrying something, a white packet.  I don't KNOW what it
was, but, Doctor, SUPPOSE-suppose it killed Patrick!"
     Then he got her out of the surgery, bundled her into his own car
and drove her back to Linchester.

     Three letters plopped through the Gage letter box when the post
came at ten.  Nancy was so SURE they weren't for her that it was all
of half an hour before she bothered to come down from the bathroom.
Instead, her hair rolled up in curlers, wet and evil-smelling with
home-perm fluid, she sat on the edge of the bath waiting for the
cooking timer to ping and BROODING ABOUT what the letters might
contain.
     Two bills, SHE THOUGHT BITTERLY, and probably a begging letter
from Jean or Shirley.  A saturated curler dripped on to her nose.

Still, that was a whole two days and goodness knew how many hours
away.  Surely Oliver would SCARCELY notice the smell when he SAW how
wonderful her hair looked, and all for twenty-five bob.
     The timer rang and she began unrolling excitedly.

     The first letter she picked up was from Jean.  Nancy KNEW that
before she saw the handwriting.  Oliver's first wife was their only
correspondent who saved old envelopes and stuck new address labels on
them.  

To her that meant a kiss.  Did it MEAN THAT TO Oliver or had it
occurred by chance?
     "My darling..." That was nice.  It was also unfamiliar and
UNEXPECTED.  She read on.  "I am WONDERING if you have FORGIVEN me for
my unkindness to you at the week-end.  I was sharp with you, even
verging on the brutal..."  How beautifully he wrote!  But that was to
be EXPECTED.  It was, after all, his line.  "Can you UNDERSTAND, my
sweet, that this was only because I hate to see you cheapening
yourself?  I FELT THAT you were making yourself the butt of those
men's wit and this HURT ME MORE bitterly that I can tell you.  So for
my sake, darling Nancy, watch you words."

"Each hath one and is one."  Hath, she decided, must be typing
error, but THE THOUGHT WAS there.  "The merest SUGGESTION THAT I might
be..."  Then there was a bit blanked out with x's "...associated with
a scandal of this kind had caused me considerable DISQUIET.  We were
not close friends of the Selby's."

pages 118-126

Nancy skipped some of it, the boring parts, and lingered the
astonishing endearments at the end.  She was so ecstatically happy
that, although she caught sight of her elated face in the hall mirror,
she hardly NOTICED that her hair was hanging in rats' tails, dripping
and perfectly straight.

     Marvell WAS DETERMINED to get Greenleaf interested in the
circumstances of Patrick's death and he THOUGHT it would do no harm to
confront him with a list of unusual poisons.  To this end he had been
to the public library and spent an instructive afternoon reading
Taylor.  He was so CARRIED AWAY that he was too late for afternoon
surgery-his ostensible mission, he DECIDED, would be to collect
another prescription-so he picked a bunch of acanthus for Bernice and
walked up to Shalom.
     "Beautiful," Bernice said.

     Bernice filled a white stone vase with water.  "You are a MINE OF
INFORMATION."
     "Let's say a DISUSED QUARRY OF RUBBLE."  The words had a bitter
sound but Marvell smiled as he watched her arrange the flowers.  "And
the RUBBLE, incidentally, is being SHAKEN BY EXPLOSIONS.  I've been
sneezing for the past three days and I've run out of the fascinating
little blue pills."

The room was a cool sanctuary.
     "It might be worth FINDING OUT exactly what you're allergic to,
have some test done," the doctor said.  "It need not be hay, you
know."

     Marvell hadn't really wanted to talk about himself but now as if
to give colour to his excuse, a tickle began at the back of his nose
and he was shaken by a vast sneeze.  When he had recovered he said
slyly:
   "Well, I SUPPOSE it can't kill me."
   "It could lead to asthma," Greenleaf said cheerfully.

     "I asked," said Marvell, re-phrasing, "if an allergy could kill
you."
     "No, you didn't.  And I KNOW exactly what you're getting at, but
Patrick wasn't allergic to wasp stings.  He had one a few days before
he died and the effect was just normal."

     "All right," Marvell said and he blew his nose.  "You REMEMBER
what we were talking about the other night?"
     "What you were talking about."

Then, as intimacy grew, the use of their styles had SEEMED too formal
and Greenleaf who hadn't been to public school baulked at the bare
surname.  This was the first time Marvell had called his friend by his
first name and Greenleaf felt a STRANGE WARMTH of heart, the SENSE OF
being accepted, this usage brings.  It made his weak where he had
INTENDED to be strong.
     "SUPPOSE," Marvell went on, "there was some substance, perfectly
harmless under normal circumstances, but lethal if anyone took it when
he'd been stung be a wasp."
     Reluctantly Greenleaf RECALLED what Freda Carnaby had told him
about the white package carried by Oliver Gage.
     "SUPPOSE, suppose.  There isn't such a substance."
     "SURE?"
     "As SURE as anyone can be."
     "I'm bored with Chantefleur Abbey, Max, and I'VE A MIND to do a
spot of detecting-with your help.  It obviously needs a doctor."
     "You're crazy," said Greenleaf unhappily.  "I'm going to give you
a drink and write out that prescription."
     "I DON'T WANT a drink.  I WANT to talk about Patrick."
     "Well?"
     "Well, since I last saw you I've been swotting up forensic
medicine..."
     "In between the sneezes, I IMAGINE."
     "In between the sneezes, as you say."

Brucine and thallium, lead and gold.  Did you KNOW there are some gold
salts called Purple of Cassius?  But of course you did.  Purple of
Cassius!"

     "It didn't conjure Patrick Selby's death."
     How do you \fIKNOW\fR?  I'll bet Glover didn't test for it."

"Max, you're a hypocrite.  How do you KNOW Patrick hadn't any
hypodermic marks unless you looked for them?  And if you looked for
them you must have SUSPECTED at the least suicide."  For a few moments
Greenleaf didn't answer him.

He had looked and found-nothing.  But had he been IN POSSESSION OF
CERTAIN FACTS of which he was now COGNISANT, would he have acted as he
had?  Wouldn't he instead have tried to dissuade Howard and Glover
from signing the death certificate?  He had nothing because Patrick
had not been his patient, because it would have been unprofessional to
poach on Howard's preserves, because, most of all, Patrick had SEEMED
a reasonably happily married man leading quite normal life.  Happily
married?

Tamsin's close dancing with Gage, Patrick's flirtation with Freda
Carnaby.  The possibility of murder had never CROSSED HIS MIND.  Why,
then, had he looked?  Just to fill in the time, he THOUGHT, ALMOST
CONVINCING himself, just for something to do.
     And yet, as he answered Marvell, he was FULLY AWARE that he was
skirting round the question.
     "I looked," he said carefully, "before Glover began his
examination.  At the time there SEEMED nothing to account for the
death.  It was afterwards that Glover found the heart damage."

"And he didn't die from wasps' stings, unless you might say he had
a certain amount of shock from the stings."
     "If be that you mean the shock affected his heart, wouldn't you
have EXPECTED him to have a heart attack at once, even while he was on
the ladder, not three or four hours later?"
     The damage caused by the rheumatic fever had been slight.
Patrick must have had it very mildly.  But in the absence of Patrick's
parents and Dr. Goldstein, who could TELL?  "Yes, I would," Greenleaf
said unhappily.
     "Max, you're COMING ROUND TO MY WAY OF THINKING.  Look, leaving
the cause of death for a moment, wasn't there something very-to use
Nancy's word-fishy about that party?"
     "You mean the picture?"
     "I MEAN the picture.  I went upstairs to get the citronella and
there was the picture.  Now, it wasn't covered up.  It was in a room
in Patrick's house.  But he didn't KNOW it was there.  Did you see his
face when he was it?"

Then Bernice went up to the fence and he saw that Nancy Gage had come
into the garden next door.  She evidently had some news to impart, for
she was talking excitedly with a kind of feverish DESIRE for the sound
of her own voice that women have who are left too much alone.
Greenleaf could only REMEMBER the last time she had looked like that,
but today there was no Oliver to stop her.

     "Did you say Tamsin was home?"
     "We ought to go over, Max, and SEE if she's all right."
     "Oh, she's all right.  Brown as a berry', said Nancy, and she
made a mock-gesture of self-reproach, protruding her teeth over her
lower lip. 

"Come back all I said.  Oliver says I mustn't talk about the Selbys
to anyone, not anyone at all because of you-KNOW-what."
     Marvell tried to catch Greenleaf's eye and when the doctor
refused to co-operate, said, "And what are we SUPPOSED to KNOW?"
     "Oliver says I mustn't go about saying Patrick didn't die
naturally because it wouldn't do him any good."  

     "Very prudent," said Marvell.
     Greenleaf opened his mouth to say something, he hardly KNEW what,
and closed it again as the telephone rang.

"Boys shouldn't have headaches.  I'm going to SEE what it's all about
and I'll look in on Tamsin on my way back."
     He went to get the car and nearly ran over Edith Gaveston's dog
as he was backing it out.

She pointed across The Green.  At first Greenleaf saw only Henry Glide
exercising his Boxer; the he NOTICED that the Hallows' windows had all
been opened, flung wide in a way they never were when Patrick was
alive.  The Weimaraner was standing by the front doors, still as a
statue carved from the creamy marble.

The car slid out on to the tarmac.  The Scottie yapped and Edith
bellowed:
     "Let's HOPE she hasn't come back to another scandal.  One's
enough but two looks like..."
     Her last words were lost in the sound of the engine but he
THOUGHT she had said 'enemy action'.  He had NO IDEA what she was
talking about but he didn't like it.  I'm getting as bad as Marvell,
he THOUGHT uneasily, compelling his eyes to the road.  Then he made
himself THINK about headaches and children and meningitis until he
came to the house where the sick boy was.

pages 127-136

     The dog Queenie traversed the lawn of Hallows, REACQUAINTING
herself with the home she had returned to after a fortnight's absence.
She ASSURED HERSELF that the squirrels' dray still remained in the elm
by the gate, that the Smith-King's cat had on several occasions
crossed the wattle fence and come to the back door, and that a
multitude of birds had descended upon the currants, leaving behind
them famine and evidence that only a dog could find.
     When she had visited the locked garage and peered through the
window, whining a little by now, she KNEW that the man she sought was
not on Hallows land.  She went back to the house, her tail quite
still, and found the woman-her woman as he had been her men-sitting in
a bedroom singing and combing her hair as she sang.  The dog Queenie
place her head in the silk lap and took a little comfort from the
combings that fell upon her like thistle-down. 
     At first Greenleaf THOUGHT that the singing came from the
wireless.  But then, as he came up to the front doors, he REALISED
that this was no professional but a girl who sang for joy, vaguely, a
little out of tune.  He rang the bell and waited.
     Tamsin was browner that he had ever seen her and he REMEMBERED
someone saying the Mrs. Prynne lived at the seaside.  She wore a
bright pink dress of the shade his mother used to call a wicked pink
and on her arms black and white bangles.
     "I came," he said, very much taken aback, "to SEE if there was
anything I could do."
     "You could come in and have a drink with me," she said and he had
the impression she was DELIBERATELY crushing the gaiety from her
voice.  She had put on weight and she looked well.

"Always so kind."
     "I SAW you were back," he said as they came into the lounge.
"I've been to see a patient in the village and I THOUGHT I'd look in .
How are you?"
     "I'm fine."  She seemed to REALISE this was wrong.  "Well, what
is it you people say?  As well as can be EXPECTED.  You've had awful
weather, haven't you?"

She stretched her arms high above her head.  "Oh Max!"
     Greenleaf didn't KNOW what to say.  He looked about him at the
room which Bernice used to say was like a set-piece in a furniture
store or a picture in \fIHouse Beautiful\fR.  

"How's Bernice?  If you've been THINKING I NEGLECTED you, I didn't
send a single postcard to anyone.  How's Oliver?"

"It's like a great hot-house without any flowers."  He had never
THOUGHT her mercenary and he was SURPRISED when she said, "I ought to
get eight or nine thousand for it.  Then there's the Selby business."

"The money's rolling in.  I don't KNOW whether to stay or sell out
to the other directors.  Really, Max, I'm quite a rich woman."
     There were such a lot of things he LONGED to ask her but could
not.  Where, for instance, if the business hadn't been doing well, had
the money come from to buy Hallows?"

"And why, most of all, was she, a widow of three weeks' standing,
singing for joy when she returned to the house where Patrick had died?
IT STRUCK him suddenly that in their conversation so intimately
concerned with him, resulting as it did solely from his death, she had
never once mentioned his name.
     She took a shell from the mantlepiece and held it to her ear.  
"I shall never marry again, Max, never."  Freedom, he THOUGHT,
unaware he was quoting Madame Roland, what crimes are committed in
your name!
     
     "Just a minute, I've something to show you."
     She took his hand in her left one and he SENSED AT THE BACK OF
HIS MIND that there was an unfamiliar bareness, something missing.
But he FORGOT about it as they entered the dining room.  The french
windows were open and beyond them the wicker furniture on the patio
was damp from many rains.  This room, he REMEMBERED, had always been
the most austere in the house, its walls painted white, its window
hung with white blinds, so that it looked like a ward in a new
hospital.  But above the long sleek radiator there had once been a
plaque of smoky blue pottery, a tiny island in a ocean of ice.

"He helped me to hang it.  Too absurd, but I THOUGHT he was going to
be sick."  She smiled and stroked the mother-of-pearl conch."

Tamsin had discarded her wedding ring.
     "She always SEEMS to be looking at you," Tamsin said, "like the
Mona Lisa."
     It was true.  The painter contrived that Salome's eyes should
meet yours, no matter in what part of the room you were standing.
     "Is it valuable?" he asked, THINKING of the thousands rich men
would pay for monstrosities.
     "Oh, no."

     She was still looking at the picture but with neither gloating
nor horror.  As he turned curiously to look at her he THOUGHT he saw
in her eyes only the same pride of possession one of his sons might
feel for a tape recorder or an electric guitar.  One woman's meat, one
man's poison...

     Instead of sitting down Greenleaf began to pace the room.  The
circumstances of Patrick's death were beginning to WORRY him a lot.
If in fact there were sufficient ground to SUSPECT homicide, wasn't it
his duty as the first medical man to have seen Patrick's body, as one
of those present at the post-mortem, to see justice done?  And if he
only SUSPECTED shouldn't he, as discreetly as possible, PROBE JUST
ENOUGH to discover whether SUSPICION was well-founded?  Some of the
information he had was given in confidence and he couldn't tell
Marvell about it.  But there was one person he could tell, one from
whom he had never FELT it necessary to keep the secrets of the
consulting room.  He could tell his wife.

     Bernice might well laugh away his fears and this, he had to
CONFESS, was what he WANTED.  She would tell him he was tired, that he
needed a holiday.

He touched the knob.  "D'you WANT this?" She shook her head.  He
switched it off and told her.
     She didn't laugh but said THOUGHTFULLY:
     "Tamsin and Oliver.  Yes, I can BELIEVE that."
     "You can?"
     "I couldn't help NOTICING the way they danced together at
Tamsin's party.  I never THOUGHT Tamsin and Patrick were very happy
together.  Except-except until a few days before he died..."

"...Tamsin kept calling Patrick darling-she was very sweet to him. I
REMEMBER THINKING how odd it was."
     "But apparently Patrick was in love with Freda Carnaby.  Freda
Carnaby after Tamsin?"
     Bernice lit a cigarette and said shrewdly, "Did you ever NOTICE
how very Teutonic Patrick was?  The first four years of his life must
have influenced him a lot..."

"...You could see it narked Patrick."
     Greenleaf's MIND WENT BACK half an hour.  Again he SAW the untidy
rooms,  the shells dribbling sand.
     "Now, Freda Carnaby, she'd be different again.  Very brisk and
practical-or she used to be.  All the time they've been here I've
never seen her in slacks or without stockings, Max.  Time and time
again I've NOTICED it, women who wear those tight little pointed shoes
are mad keen on polishing and turning out rooms.  Patrick was cruel,
too, you know, Max, but I don't think cruelty would get very far with
Tamsin."

     "You may be right," Greenleaf said.  "But FORGET the Carnabys for
a minute.  What about Gage?  I can IMAGINE he might WANT to marry
Tamsin." He grinned faintly."

"...Would Gage want to"-he almost baulked at the word-"to \fIkill\fR
him?"
     Bernice said UNEXPECTEDLY, "He's rather a violent man."
     "Violent?  Oliver Gage?"

     "Nancy told me something when they first came here.  I didn't
repeat it because I KNOW how you hate that kind of thing.  She was
proud of it."

"...Oliver and the fiance had a violent quarrel and the upshot of it
was Oliver hit him over the head with a billiard cue."
     Greenleaf smiled INCREDULOUSLY.
     "It isn't really funny, Max."

     "One of those insecticides?" bernice asked vaguely.  "YOU KNOW,
you read about them in the papers.  I THOUGHT they weren't supposed to
leave any trace."
     "Not in the body maybe."

She reached for the cigarettes, caught her husband's eye and let her
hand drop.
     "Besides, why would Gage WANT to do away with Patrick?  There's
always divorce.  Unless he couldn't afford two divorces.  He'd have to
pay the costs of both of them, REMEMBER."
     "On the other hand, Tamsin has her private income."

     "Wherever I go I keep hearing about that private income.  What
does it amount to, I'd LIKE TO KNOW.  Hundreds?..."

"...This can't be happening, not here in Linchester."
     Reading her THOUGHTS, he said gently, "Whatever we have said no
one can hear us."
     "But we have said it."
     "Sit down," he said.  "Listen.  There's something we've got to
REALISE.  If someone did kill Patrick, Tamsin must be in it too..."    

"...I left her and she says she went to bed.  You're not going to tell
me someone got into the house without her KNOWING?"
     "You say she was happy?"

"...She put her arms round the dog and she cried.  Bernice, I THINK
she was crying from relief."
     "What will you do?"

pages 137-142

"Gone are the days of all that mashing and fiddling about with
strainers, Mrs. Smith-King.  I always say you young mothers don't KNOW
how lucky you are.  A large tin of baby powder and the Virol."  He
handed the things to Linda who wrapped each up efficiently and sealed
it with sellotape.

She jerked Jeremy's hand from its exploration of of Linda's carefully
arranged display of bathing caps, each an improbably coloured wig of
nylon hair on a rubber scalp.  "I can't tell you how RELIEVED I am to
be going at all.  My husband's had a very worrying time lately with
the business but now everything's panned out well and he'll be able to
take a rest."

Jeremy listened, learning terror at his mother's knee.  "You might not
BELIEVE it but Patrick Selby was all set to ruin Den's business just
because he once hit that dog.  I mean, really!  IMAGINE trying to take
away someone's livelihood just because he took a stick to an animal."
     Marvell said softly:
     "The dog recovered from the bite, the man it was that died."
     "Now look, I didn't MEAN ..."  A deep flush spread unbecomingly
across her lantern jaws.

But it's bloody funny, nobody loved him.  His wife was bored with him,
he got in the way of his wife's lover-Oh, I've FOUND out about
that-his girl friend's brother was afraid of him.  Even I was annoyed
with him because he cut down my father's trees.

He told me he was trying to get a Stock Exchange quotation for his
shares and expand a bit.  Do you SUPPOSE he had his old fishy eye on
Smith-King's little lot?"
     "I'm not listening."
     "Do you happen to KNOW what Smith-King's line is?"
     "Chemicals." Greenleaf said.
     "Drugs mainly.  And you REALISE what that means.  He must have
access to all kinds of lethal stuff..."

     Bernice had suggested insecticides.  DOUBT STIRRED until
Greenleaf remembered how he had answered her.  "You'll have to stop
all this, YOU KNOW," he said.  
     "Nobody could have got into the house because Tamsin was there."

     "She came," Marvell said, "to bring me the currants.  You
REMEMBER the currants?  She picked them before the party and put them
in a trug."
     "A what?"
     "Sorry.  I keep FORGETTING you're not a countryman.  It's a kind
of wooden basket, a gardener's basket.  In all the fuss I FORGOT them
and Tamsin brought them up to me.  It must have been all of midnight."
     Midnight, Greenleaf THOUGHT, and she walked through the woods
alone.  She came down here while Patrick-if not, as far as anyone
then KNEW, dying-was at least ill and in pain.  She came to bring a
basket of currants!  It was no good, he would never UNDERSTAND the
habits of the English countryside.  But Tamsin was accustomed to them.

"...She was carrying the trug and that straw handbag Edith Gaveston
gave her for a birthday present.  I was-well, somewhat SURPRISED to
see her." He straightened up and stepped into the porch.  greenleaf
FANCIED that he was embarrassed, for, as he lifted the can and began
watering the pot plants that stood on the shelves, he kept his face
turned away.
     "She came all this way to give you some currants?"

He stroked a long spear-shaped leaf and, wheeling round suddenly, said
fiercely:  "My God, Max, don't you THINK I REALISE?  If I'd gone in I
might have been able to do something."
     "You couldn't KNOW."
     "And Tamsin...?"
     "THOUGHT he was asleep," he said, voicing a CONFIDENCE he didn't
FEEL.  "Why did she really come?"

     "Why did she come?"
     "That," Marvell said, "is something I can't really tell you,"
Greenleaf looked at him, PUZZLED as to whether he MEANT he refused to
tell him or was unable to do so.  But Marvell said no more and
presently the doctor left him.
     He hadn't MEANT to go back to the village and into Waller's shop.
He \fIMEANT\fR to turn off at the Manor gates, but SOMETHING IMPELLED
HIM on down the hill, UNEASE perhaps, or the KNOWLEDGE that Tamsin had
left Patrick alone on the night he died.
     "I want a tin of Vesprid," he said, cutting short Waller's
obsequious greeting.

     Waller's voice trailed away.  In this company, and only then, was
his confidence shaken.  A SMALL VOICE WITHIN HIS HEART TOLD HIM that
to Greenleaf, Howard and their partners, he could never be more than
the village medicine man.  "At least...well, I don't have to tell
\fIyou\fR, Doctor."
     When he got home Greenleaf transferred some of the liquid into a
small bottle and wrapped it up.  It was far-fetched, incredibly
far-fetched, to IMAGINE Edward Carnaby going back to Hallows after the
party, to WONDER if Freda's story of Gage and the white packet was a
cover-up for her brother's own trip with a tin of insecticide.  Or was
it?

pages 143-148

     The Chantflower Rural Council Dustmen hadn't BARGAINED ON the
extra load of rubbish that awaited them outside the Hallows back door.
They grumbled loudly, muttering about slipped discs and no overtime.

     "She hasn't even bothered to take the tissue paper out."
     "Goodness," Nancy giggled, "I don't know what use she THINKS a
handbag is to a starving Asian."  And her eyes goggled as she IMAGINED
an emaciated peasant clutching Edith's present against her rags.
     "The clothes will be useful though," Bernice said pacifically.
     Nancy stared in HORRIFIED WONDER as the doctor's wife lifted from
the case the slacks and tee-shirts Patrick had worn on the evening of
his death.  For all their careful laundering they suggested a shroud.

While she was talking Bernice quietly sealed the cases and refilled
the coffee pot.
     Returning after a few moments, she was AWARE from Nancy's
expression that the conversation had taken a different and more
exciting turn.  The two women under the cedar tree wore ghoulish
lugubrious looks.

Bernice sat down again, listening but not participating.
     "Of course I don't KNOW the details," Nancy was saying.
     "Black, please, Bernice," Edith said.  "Well, that Mrs. Selby-I
MEAN Patrick's mother-it gets so confusing, doesn't it?  That Mrs.
Selby ran away with another man..."

"You're romanticising, Edith.  You can't possibly KNOW all this."
     "On the contrary.  I KNOW it for certain."  Edith drew herself
up, the lady of the manor making her morning calls.

"It so happens I read the account of the inquest in \fIThe Times.\fR
It STUCK IN MY MIND and when Nancy mentioned the suicide it ALL CAME
BACK TO ME.  Selby, a glass factory."

     "I must love you and leave you.  Oh, Bernice, I nearly FORGOT to
ask you.  Have you got the name of that man who put up your summer
house?"     
     "I can't REMEMBER.  Max would know."

"Aren't men the end?"
     I really ought to thank Tamsin properly for the clothes, Bernice
THOUGHT after they had both gone.  But she FELT RELUCTANT to go.
Hardly anyone had set eyes on Tamsin since her return.  She had become
like a sleeping beauty shut up in her glass castle, or like a lurking
witch.  Bernice couldn't MAKE UP HER MIND whether Tamsin was really
bad or whether the gossip had created IN HER OWN FANCY AN UNREAL
Tamsin, a false clever poisoner.  Anyway, she must go and be polite.
   
     "I went to collect my shilling," he said, "but I couldn't find
\fIher\fR."  He picked up a flat stone and CONCENTRATED on sending it
skimming across the water.  "The dog's there, though."
     He threw this piece of information out quite casually but Bernice
REMEMBERED what Max had told her and detected a CURRENT OF FEAR.
     "I'm on my way over now," she said.

     Queenie was indeed there so Tamsin must be too.  As she put out
her hand to the dog's soft mouth Bernice had a STRANGE FEELING that
SOMETHING OUGHT TO CLICK.  When Tamsin went out without the dog she
always shut her in the kitchen.  The Weimaraner had been bred as a
sentinel as well as a hunter.  What was it Max said last night about
Tamsin visiting Crispin Marvell?  She stopped and PONDERED.  Tamsin's
voice from above BROKE INTO HER REVERIE.
     "Come on in.  I was in the bath."

pages 148-156

     "Ughugh," he said.
     At once she KNEW what he had seen.  Surely nothing else Tamsin
possessed could summon that squeamish pallor even in a child of ten.

"...He ran away and then \fIit\fR happened.  The fuss and bother-you
CAN'T IMAGINE." 
     Bernice was just going to ask what had happened when Peter said
sullenly, "Can I have my shilling?"

     The moment of revelation had passed.  Tamsin evidently THOUGHT
Bernice had come to give Peter moral support, for she opened the door
to show them both out.
     "I only came to thank you for the things."

     Edith was the first person on Linchester to FIND OUT that Hallows
was sold and she got it from the gardener the Gavestons shared with
Tamsin.  As soon as he had told her, over mid-morning tea in the
utility room, she slipped out to pass the news on to Mrs. Glide.
Henry, after all, ought to be PLEASED that his handiwork found favour
in the sight of buyers.  On her way back she met Marvell returning
from the shops with his sparse groceries in a string bag.

"It was \fIthere\fR, like the rock of Ages."
     He smiled, murmured something, his mind WORKING FURIOUSLY.  So
Tamsin was leaving soon, escaping...When Edith had left him he walked
slowly across the Green towards Shalom.  

Tamsin would soon be gone and with her departure surely the rumours
would cease.  In a fortnights' time he would be off on holiday and
when he came back Nancy would be TOO PREOCCUPIED with plans for the
baby, Freda too tranquilised by drugs to bother about the vanished
Selbys.  And yet, HE THOUGHT as he began to eat the cold lunch Bernice
had left him, Marvell might want him for something quite different.
In the past he had often been summoned to have an emergency injection
of piriton when Marvell was almost numbed and blinded by hay fever.

Well, it was a way of passing his free afternoon.
     As he washed his plate and stuck it in the rack to DRAIN, HE
THOUGHT WITH THE SMALL GRAIN OF SUPERIORITY he allowed himself, that
when people spoke of the rewards of a medical vocation they ignored
this one:  The pleasure of shooting the layman's theories down in
flames.
     On the wooden bench by the back door Marvell sat reading a recipe
for ratafia.

Brandy, peach kernels, sugar, honey, orange flower water...He had no
peaches, or the money to but them.  The recipe said five hundred
kernels and, basking in the warm soft sunlight, he IMAGINED WITH some
delight the preliminary labour to the making of ratafia:  the
consumption of those five hundred ripe peaches.
     Presently he got up and began to walk around the house, touching
the bricks, themselves peach-coloured.  When he came to the side wall
where Henry Glide had discovered the fissure, the terrible sign that
the whole building was beginning to subside, he closed his eyes and
saw only a red mist filled with whirling objects.  Then, because he
refused to DENY facts and DECEIVE HIMSELF, he forced his fingers to
seek the crack as a man, fearful of cancer yet resolute, compels his
hand to probe the swelling in his body.
     He jumped when Greenleaf coughed behind him.
     "Penny for you THOUGHTS."
     "THEY'RE worth more than that," Marvell said lightly.  "To be
precise a thousand pounds."
     Greenleaf looked at him inquiringly.
     "That," said Marvell, "is the price Glide in PREPARED to pay me
for this land."
     "You're selling?  But this place-I THOUGHT you were so fond of
it."  Greenleaf described with splayed fingers a wide arc that
embraced the squat yet elegant house, the shaven lawn, the orchard and
the hawthorn hedge over which honeysuckle climbed, a parasite more
lovely than its prey.  All this MEANT little to the doctor but by a
terrific effort of EMPATHY he had learned its value to his friend.
Even he who could scarcely TELL a lily from a rose, FELT THAT here the
air smelled more sweetly and the sun's heat was moderated to a mellow
beneficence.  "The house.  It's so old..."

"People like that sort of thing.  They'd WANT to but it."
     Marvell shook his head.  He was still holding the recipe book and
slowly the THOUGHT FORMED in his MIND:  I will make some ratafia, just
a very small quantity, to take away and to REMIND me...
     ALOUD he said to Greenleaf:  "It's falling down.  The council
says it's not safe to live in.  I've had Glide here to look at in and
all he said was he'd give me a thousand for the land."
     "How long have you KNOWN?"
     "Oh, about a month now.  A thousand's good going, YOU KNOW.  When
the Marvells had Andreas Quercus-he was really called Andrew Oakes or
something-when they had him build this place for four old persons of
the parish of Chantflower, they DIDN'T CARE that you could only get to
it down a muddy land and the old persons were too grateful to care."
     With what he felt to be tremendous inadequacy, Greenleaf said:
"I'm sorry.  Where will you live?"  So many QUESTIONS LEAPT TO HIS
MIND,  Have you any money?  What will you live on?

The proximity of Linchester made poverty a more than usually shameful
thing.
     "I SUPPOSE I can get a room somewhere.  I can teach.  I shall
have my thousand pounds.  You'd be SURPRISED what a long time I can
live on a thousand pounds."  He laughed dryly and Greenleaf, seeing
him IN THE LIGHT OF THIS NEW KNOWLEDGE, NOTICED how gaunt he was.
This, then, was why Marvell had sent for him, to unburden his soul.  I
wonder, HE THOUGHT, if I could rake up a bit, just to tide him over
and have the place made water-tight.  But Marvell's next words
temporarily BANISHED ALL THOUGHT of a loan.
     "I saw Edith this morning," he said, "as I was coming back from
the village..."

     "Then she'll soon be gone," said Greenleaf, relieved.
     "And since perhaps neither of us will ever see her again I THINK
I can tell you why she came to see me on the night Patrick died."

     He COULD SEE HER NOW as she had come up through the orchard,
swinging her basket, all pale in the moonlight with her mist-coloured
dress, and paler still when she came within the radiance of his lamp.
To his FANCIFUL IMAGINATION the currants had SEEMED like beads of
white jade veined with crimson.  For all her affected speech, the
superlatives that came from her lips so often that they lost their
meaning and their force, her face had always been a mask, a SHIELD
deliberately maintained to HIDE INTELLECTUAL CUNNING or perhaps a
chance trick nature concealing only vacuity.
     "I THINK she is really very clever," he said to Greenleaf.
     He had put his head out of the window and called to her, then
gone into the garden and asked after Patrick.

"...I would gave come up tomorrow."
     "Crispin darling, how should I KNOW what you do here in your
enchanted cottage?  You might have WANTED to make your wine tonight at
some special witching hour."
     "I'll walk back with you."

This essence with its hint of witchcraft enfanced the atmosphere of
magic unreality.
     "So we sat down," he said, SHAKING HIS SHOULDERS AS IF TO SHED A
MEMORY.  "We sat a long way from each other but the lamp was between
us and YOU KNOW what oil lamps are.  the SEEM to enclose you in a
little snug circle.  For a while we talked the usual trivia...."

     "And then?"
     "I want you to UNDERSTAND how curiously intimate the whole
situation was, the darkness around us, the circle of light.  After a
while she got up and sat beside me on the footstool.  She took my hand
and said she SUPPOSED I REALISED she hadn't been happy with Patrick
for a long time.  She's got one of those think skins that can't blush,
but I felt the blush was there."
     "Everyone can blush," said the doctor.
     "Well, be that as it may, she went on to tell me she KNEW why I
came to the house so often.  I didn't say a word.  It was horribly
awkward.  She kept hold of my hand and she said she'd only REALISED
how I felt when I brought her the mead and roses.  Max, BELIEVE ME,
they were just presents for a pretty woman from a man who can't afford
scent or jewellery."
     "I BELIEVE you."
     "Suddenly she said very abruptly:  'Patrick's leaving me.  He
WANTS a divorce.  In a year I'll be free, Crispin.'  It was a blunt
proposal of marriage."  Marvell went on quickly:  "I don't WANT
marriage.  For one thing I can't afford it.  Everybody THINKS I'm
comfortably off, but the fact is most of the money my father got for
Linchester went in death duties.  What was left was divided between my
brother, my sister and myself and my share went on buying the
almshouses..."


"...But I couldn't tell Tamsin all that.  I FELT she might offer me
her own money."
     "That mysterious private income," Greenleaf said.

"...It's invested in oil or something and she has the income for life.
I BELIEVE it would pass to her children, if she ever had any children.
So, YOU SEE, I couldn't talk about money to her.  Instead I said I was
too old for her.  I'm fifty, Max.  She has a lot of natural dignity,
but I THOUGHT she was going to cry.  I don't MIND telling you, it was
the most embarrassing experience of my life.  I suppose I was weak.  I
said quite truthfully that she was the most beautiful and most
exciting woman i KNEW.  Then I said, "Wait till the year is up.  I'll
come and SEE if you've CHANGED YOUR MIND."  But she only laughed.

"'...Did you know?'  I REALISED she was telling me I'd be taking Gage's
leavings."
     "And that was all?"

"...But the most extraordinary thing was when I saw her the day after
Patrick died, the next day.  I didn't WANT to go, Max, but I FELT THAT
I should.  She was as cold as ice...."

     "Peculiar," Greenleaf said.
     "I don't MIND telling you," Marvell said with a smile, "it was a
hell of a relief."

pages 159-167

     Two days later Marvell began extracting honey.  Greenleaf's jar
would be ready for him in the afternoon, he told the doctor, if he
CARED to come along and collect it, but at half-past three Greenleaf
was still sitting in his deckchair under the shade of the cedar tree.
Bernice had gone out and he was half-asleep.  Each time he nodded off,
SNATCHES OF DREAMS CREPT UP ON him, bright pictures rather than actual
episodes.  But they were not pleasant IMAGES and they MIRRORED a
subconscious of which he had been UNAWARE.  Worst of all was the
hideous cameo of Tamsin's painting that spiralled and enlarged,
twisted and distorted until the head on the plate became Patrick's.
He jolted out of sleep to a shrill insistent ringing.  CONSCIOUSNESS,
REALITY, CAME back as with the familiar feel of the canvas, the cool
springy grass, he sought tranquillity.  Almost in the past days he had
found peace of MIND.  Was it all there still BELOW THE SURFACE, a
WHIRLPOOL of fear and doubt and indecision?  The ringing continued and
he was suddenly AWARE that this was NOT A SOUND WITHIN HIS HEAD, but
the peal of a real bell, the telephone bell.
     REMINDING himself that he was SUPPOSED to be on call, he hastened
into the morning room.  It was Edward Carnaby.
     "I THOUGHT I wasn't going to get you," he said reproachfully.
"It's my Cherly, my daughter.  A wasp got her on the lip, Doctor.  Her
and Freda, they were having a bit of a picnic on The Green and this
wasp was on a piece of cake..."
     "Her lip?" From Patrick, Greeleaf's THOUGHTS TRAVELLED BACK to
the dead miner.  "Not inside her mouth?"

     "All right, I'll come."
     "I THOUGHT we'd seen the last of those wasps," he said as he
walked into the Carnaby lounge.  Of course it was the only living room
they had but it SEEMED strange to him to cover the entire centre of
the carpet with what looked like a dismantled internal combustion
engine spread on sheets of newspaper.
     "You'll have to excuse the mess," Carnaby said, blackening his
fingers in his haste to remove obstacles from the doctor's path.  "I
borrowed it from the class.  I CAN'T SEEM to..."

Greenleaf picked his way over to her, stepping gingerly across coils
and wheels.  He THOUGHT he had seldom seen anyone look so tense.  Her
mouth was set as if she was grinding her teeth and the tears poured
down her cheeks.

"...You'll take her to the hospital and we'll never see her again."
     He was SURPRISED at so much emotion for she had never SEEMED to
care for the child.  Patrick's death must have left a REAL WOUND into
which a new-found maternal love MIGHT POUR.  Patrick, always back to
Patrick...He looked quickly at Carnaby, wondering when the report
would come from the analyst, before saying sharply to Freda:
     "If you can't control yourself, Miss Carnaby, you'd better go
outside."

     Freda watched her go with tragic eyes.  She evidently THOUGHT
Greenleaf had got rid of Cheryl in order to impart confidential
information as to her probable fate.  She looked affronted when he
said instead:
     "Patrick Selby did not die of wasp stings..."

"What's the matter with you?"
     "Everybody KNOWS Patrick didn't die of heart failure," she said
stubbornly.
     Greenleaf let it pass.

The sob that caught her throat came out ludicrously like a hiccup.
"She's all I've got now," she said.  "Patrick-I could have given him
children.  He WANTED children.  I'll never get married now, never,
never!"

Recalling what Bernice had said, Greenleaf wondered whether Freda's
renewed cries were caused by true grief of the possible damage to the
paintwork.  Then, as he stood, murmuring assurances to Carnaby, the
PENNY DROPPED.  NOT THE WHOLE PENNY, BUT A FRACTION OF IT, farthing
perhaps.
     "She'll be all right," he said mechanically.
    
     Back at Shalom his desk-chair awaited him.  He sat down,
CONSCIOUS that on his way round The Circle he had passed Sheila
Macdonald and Paul Gaveston without even a smile or a wave.  they had
been shadows compared WITH THE REALITY OF HIS THOUGHTS.  BEFORE HIS
EYES HE COULD AGAIN SEE PATRICK'S BODY in the bed at Hallows that
Sunday morning, the thin freckled arms spread across the sheet,
sleeves pushed back for coolness.  And the yellowish mottled skin red
swellings. 

But Carnaby had watch the wasps attack, he had been there in the line
of fire staring from the bathroom window, and Freda had sat at
Patrick's feet, holding his hand.  Of all the guests at the party they
were in the best position to KNOW.  But at the same time he knew he
wasn't wrong.  

"...Always having to bob up and down like jack-on-the-boxes."
     "I'm AFRAID Bernice has taken the boys into Nottingham."
     "NEVER MIND.  Actually I came to see you..."

     "Lovely.  What a wonderful MEMORY!  What do you THINK?  As I was
coming across The Green I met that funny little Carnaby girl with an
enormous lump in her lip...."

     "Oh, you doctors and your anti-biotics.  I'm a great BELIEVER in
the old-fashioned remedies."  She spoke with a middle-aged complacency
and Greenleaf THOUGHT he knew exactly what she would be like in
fifteen years' time, stout, an encyclopaedia of outworn and inaccurate
advice, the very prototype of an old wife spinning old wives' tales.
"If I've said it once I've said it a dozen times, Patrick would be
alive today if Tamsin had only used bi-carb."  As an AFTER-THOUGHT she
exclaimed in an advertising catch phrase, "and so reasonably priced!"
     Momentarily Greenleaf closed his eyes.

"...Anyway, he trotted across with his little packet.."  It was an
absurd description of the movement of that graceful, saturnine man,
but Greenleaf was too interested to NOTICE.  "...but Tamsin must have
gone to bed.  She'd forgot to lock the back door because he tried it,
but that Queenie was shut up in the kitchen and she wouldn't let him
in."

Simply Oliver Gage taking bi-carbonate of soda to his mistress's
husband.  And probably, he THOUGHT vulgarly, hoping for a little more
love on the side.  No wonder he waited for me to go.

The feeble motives of Edith Gaveston and Denholm Smith-King evaporated
like puddles in the sun.  But Tamsin had a MOTIVE, OR RATHER MANY
MOTIVES WHICH CRYSTALLISED INTO A GIGANTIC SINGLE DRIVE against
Patrick's life.  Tamsin was rich now and free.

pages 168-179

     Patrick had died too late.  Greenleaf REPEATED THE SENTENCE TO
HIMSELF as he came up to the front door Marvell's house.  Patrick had
died too late.

Marvell had suggested it at the time the rumors began and Greenleaf
had shrugged it off.  Now he REALISED that it was this fact which all
the time had been NAGGING AT HIS MIND.  Had he died soon after
receiving the stings or even if he had had a heart attack on seeing
the picture-for Greenleaf was BEGINNING TO BELIEVE that in Patrick's
history it corresponded to the something nasty in the woodshed of
Freudian psychology-there would have been no mystery.  But Patrick had
died hours later.

At last he went round to the back and sat down on the bench.
     He had come for his honey, and after much HEART-SEARCHING, to
offer his friend a loan.  Talking it over with Bernice after she came
back from Nottingham, he had THOUGHT he could raise a few hundred,
enough perhaps to have the house made habitable according to the
standards of Chantflower Rural Council.  It was an awkward mission
even though he INTENDED to be quite pompous about it, insisting for
the sake of Marvell's pride on the money being repated at the normal
rate of interest-Marvell would have to put his back into the history
of Chantefleur Abbey.  I am a peasant, he THOUGHT, and he is an
aristocrat (the serfs to the wolves syndrome again.)  He might hit me.
All alone in the garden, he CHUCKLED FAINTLY TO HIMSELF.  He didn't
THINK Marvell would do that.
     Presently he got up and walked about, for he was nervous.  He
hadn't COUNTED ON having to wait.  Perhaps Marvell would be away for
hours and he would have screwed up his courage in vain.

He had once shown the doctor the tacky grey candy he made for them
from boiled sugar.  But, just the same, BEWILDERMENT over their loss
made them angry.
     There were three hives made of white painted wood and this had
SURPRISED Greenleaf the first time he had seen them for he had
expected the igloos of plaited straw you see in children's picture
books.  Beneath the entrance to each hive-a slit between the two
lowest boards-was a wooden step or platform on to which the bees
issued, trickling forth in a thin dark stream.

There was warmth in it and richness and an immense controlled
activity.
     For a moment he had FORGOTTEN that these insects were not simply
harvesters; they were armed.  then, as he eased himself into a sitting
position, one of them appeared suddenly from a tree or perhaps from
the roof of the hive.  

How horrible, how treacherous Nature could be!  You contemplated it
with the eye of an aesthete or a sociologist, and just as you were
beginning to SEE there might be something in it after all, it rose and
struck you, attacked you...He gasped and ran, glad that there was no
one to see him.

When he had slammed the door between himself and his pursuers, he sat
down on the garden roller, sweating.  He KNEW NOW how Patrick Selby
had died.

     "But wouldn't he have swelled up?"  Bernice asked.  "I THOUGHT
the histamine made you swell up all over."
     "Yes, it does." Greenleaf bent over the kitchen sink, washing
tool-shed cobwebs from his hands.  "I gave him anti-histamine..."
     "Why didn't it work, Max?"
     "I EXPECTED it did, up to a point.  Don't FORGET, Patrick wasn't
allergic to wasp stings.  But if he was allergic to \fIbee\fR stings,
as I think he must have been, the histamine reaction would have been
very strong."

"Four wasp stings and then you get stung by a bee in your own
bedroom?"
     "He must have KNOWN he was allergic to bee stings."
     "Not necessarily, although I THINK he did.  He hated honey.
Remember?  He KNEW about it all right and someone else KNEW too."
     "You mean he told someone?"

"At the moment I can only say it to you, but I may have to tell the
police.  People with this sort of allergy usually FIND OUT about it
when they're children.  They get stung, have the adrenalin, and
afterwards they're careful never to get another.  But others KNOW
about it, the people who were there at the time."  Turning his back on
the window behind which Nature seemed to seethe, he looked at the
manufactured, man-made things in the modern kitchen, and at civilised,
corseted, powdered Bernice.

"They'd known each other since they were children.  Even if he
half-forgot it, never spoke of it, she might REMEMBER.
     "So simple, wasn't it?  Patrick has the wasp stings and he takes
the sodium amytal to make him sleep heavily.  When he's asleep she
goes to the only place where she can be SURE OF getting hold of a bee,
Marvell's orchard, and she takes with her a \fIstraw\fR handbag."
     "I see."

"But why stay there, why make love to him?"
     "I don't KNOW.  So it was a good excuse for coming?  I tell you I
DON'T KNOW, Bernice.  But when she got back Patrick was under heavy
sedation."

"I've sold my house and the solicitor's dealing with everything.
Queenie and I-we don't KNOW where we're going but we're going to drive
and drive.  All the furniture-they've bought that too."

"He wasn't awfully mature, you know.  I MEAN, people grow out of
things like that, don't they?  Like being frightened of the dark."

In a moment he would have to begin question her.  He had NO IDEA HOW
she react.  In films, in plays, they confessed and either grew violent
of threw themselves upon your mercy. His mission nauseated him.
     She went on dreamily, apparently SUSPECTING nothing:
     "That picture, it used to hang in a room in my grandmother's
house in London. "
 
"He was nine and I was seven.  Grandmother THOUGHT he was wonderful."
Her laughter was dry and faintly bitter.

"She left her money to me.  So sweet!"
     If only she would tell him something significant, something to
make him FEEL JUSTIFIED in setting in motion the machinery that would
send this sprite-like creature, this breathless waif of a woman, to a
long incarceration.  And yet...Tamsin in Holloway, Tamsin coarsened,
roughened in speech and in manners.  It was UNTHINKABLE.
     "That was nice for you," he said stupidly.

"It gave her a sort of pathological fear of divorce."
     This is it, he THOUGHT.  He needed to hear and at the same time
he wanted to stop her.  Almost unconsciously he fumbled along the
window sill.
     "Did you WANT a cigarette, Max?"
     Taking one from the silver box, he said, "I've given it up,: and
lit it with shaking fingers.
     "What was I saying?  Oh, yes, about Grandmother.  She KNEW I
wasn't getting on all that well with Patrick.  Funny, she made the
match and she WANTED us to make a go of it.  Just because we were
cousins she THOUGHT we'd be alike.  How wrong she was!"

"Patrick wasn't mentioned at all.  I don't know if she THOUGHT he'd
had enough from his father-that went on this house-or perhaps she
RESENTED it because he never went to see her.  Anyway, she left all
her money to me, the income, not the capital, on condition..."
  
     "On condition Patrick and I were never divorced!"
     O God, he THOUGHT, how it all fits, a pattern, a puzzle like
those things the boys used to have, when you have to make the ball
bearing drop into the right slots.
     "As if I WANTED to be divorced," she said.  "I can't support
myself."

Without the money from her Oliver Gage would have been unable to marry
her, for the costs of her divorce and Nancy's would have fallen on
him.  Like everyone else he must have been DECEIVED ABOUT her income
until she got cold feet and told him.  He pictured her confessing to
Gage; then, when he recoiled from her, running ashamed and
wretched-for Tamsin, he was sure, was no nymphomaniac-to Marvell, her
last resort.  When Marvell refused her there was only one way out...
     "Doesn't anybody KNOW?" he asked sharply, not bothering to
conceal A CURIOSITY she must take for impertinence. 
     "It was so humiliating," she said, whispering now.  "Everybody
THOUGHT I was quite well-off, independent.  But if Patrick had
divorced me I would have been-I would have been destitute."
     It was a sudden bare revelation of MOTIVE and it RECALLED him to
the real reason of his visit.
     "Tamsin..." he began.

     "You mean Freda Carnaby?  I KNOW all about that.  Please!"

"If Patrick could have made anyone happy it was Freda Carnaby.  But
you mustn't THINK I drove him to it.  It was only because of
that-Oliver and me...I was so lonely, Max?"
     He was HORRIFIED that she should think him capable of repeating
gossip to her and to stop her he blundered into the middle of it,
forgetting his doctor's discretion.
     "No, no."

     Was it possible that, immured here since her return, she had
heard nothing of the gossip?  She turned on him, quivering, and he
WONDERED if this was the beginning of the violence he EXPECTED.
     "He must have," she cried.

     So intense was her tone that Greenleaf half-turned towards the
door.
     "You see what I MEAN?  Sometimes when I go upstairs I THINK to
myself, SUPPOSE I see his writing in the dust on the dressing-table?
That's what he used to do."

     Were some marriages really like that?  Yes, it fitted with what
he had KNOWN of Patrick's character.  He could imagine a freckled
finger with a close-trimmed nail moving deliberately across the black
glass, crossing the \fIt\fR, dotting the \fIi\fR.
     Although he knew her moods, how suddenly hysteria was liable to
wistfulness or vague reminiscing, he was startled when she burst out
in a ragged voice:
     "I'm AFRAID TO GO in his room!  He's dead but suppose-SUPPOSE the
writing was there just the same?"
     "Tamsin."  He must put an end to this.

It was stupid to feel uneasy, to remember the frightened charwoman,
the Smith-King children.  She sat down again and he REFLECTED that
they were shut in now with the strong watchful dog and that all the
neighbours were away on holiday.
     "How many did he have when he came if from the garden?"

Dry brown cheek pressed against wet brown nose, two pairs of eyes
looking at him.
     "I THINK he was stung by a bee, Tamsin."
     At a word from her the dog would spring.

pages 180-184

"The furniture's always sliding about."
     I make a bad policeman, he THOUGHT, blinking and adjusting his
chair back in its position by the window.  But where was the dog and
why wasn't he in the process of being mauled?

The drama had been nothing but a domestic game with a pet.  And
Tamsin, he saw had NOTICED ONLY that he was startled by the sudden
skidding of a chair.  "Talking of insects," she said, "it's funny
about the bee."

"He put out his hand and it stung him."
     The SHOCK WAS SUBSIDING now.
     "What happened?" he asked rather shakily.

"They put him to be and the doctor came.  I REMEMBER I said, 'He must
be an awful coward to have a doctor for a bee sting.  I bet you
wouldn't have got the doctor for me,' and they sent me to my room."

"He only said he didn't like bees and he couldn't stand honey."
     "Didn't it ever OCCUR TO YOU that he might be allergic to bee
stings?"
     "I didn't know you could be," she said, her eyes wide with
surprise.
     He almost BELIEVED her.  He WANTED to BELIEVE her, to say, "Yes,
you can go.  Be happy, Tamsin.  Drive and drive-far away!"
     Now more than ever it SEEMED likely that the bee had got there by
chance.  Hadn't he opened the window in the balcony room himself?

Wasps stung when they were provoked; perhaps the same was true of bees
and Patrick's killer, alighting on his exposed arm, had been alerted
into venom by a twitch or a galvanic start from the sleeping man.  If
Tamsin were guilty she would CLUTCH at the possibility of an accident
and no law could touch her.

     But dreams can change into nightmares...
     then she said something that entirely ALTERED THE PICTURE he had
made of her.  She was not stupid, now was she a murderess.

Dreamy, vague children often do best in examinations, drawing
solutions from their inner lives.  "I KNOW it couldn't.  Crispin told
me something about bees once.  They're different from wasps and when
they sting they die."

"We'd have seen it!"
     UNWITTINGLY he had given her a loophole.  A guilty woman would
have wriggled through it.  Tamsin, in her innocence, was confirming
that her husband had been murdered.
     "Max, YOU DON'T MEAN you THINK I...?"
     "No, Tamsin, no."
     "I'm GLAD he's dead.  I am."

She paused and drew a little sobbing breath, rubbing away the frown
lines with her ringless fingers.  "He LIKED to make people suffer,
Max.  Even the Smith-Kings."

     "He went on and on about it.  He even tried to THINK of ways of
upsetting the will.  But d'you KNOW something?  I don't WANT to be
married.  I've had enough of marriage."

"His house is falling down and he won't get much for that land."
     She was THUNDERSTRUCK.  The mask slipped at last and her big
golden eyes widened and blazed.
     "But his books...?"
     "I don't BELIEVE he ever finishes them."
    to him it was the saddest of stories, that Marvell should have to
leave the house he loved, that her nightmare of the room with the gas
ring might become real to him.

     "What's so funny?"
      She no longer CARED what he might THINK or say.
     "It's mad, it's ridiculous!  He spent the night here, you know,
the night Patrick died."

"I was so scared when you made me sit on the bed in the back bedroom.
I FELT YOU must SENSE that-that I hadn't been alone.  Oh, Max, Max,
don't you see how crazy it is?"  He stared, his hurt SUSPICION
MELTING, for he SAW THAT she was laughing at herself.  "I WANTED to
marry him for his money," she said, "and he WANTED to marry me for
mine, and the mad thing is we hadn't either of us got a bean!"

pages 185-198

     She walked with him to the gate.  He shook hands with her and
impulsively-because he was ashamed of the THOUGHTS HE HAD
HARBOURED-kissed her cheek.
     "Can I go tomorrow? "

In denying the possibility of accidental death she had declared, if
not in words, that Patrick had been murdered.  But Greenleaf knew she
hadn't REALISED it yet.  SOMETIMES IT WOULD REACH HER, SURFACING ON TO
HER MIND THROUGH THAT RICH, JUMBLED SUBCONSCIOUS, and then perhaps it
would REGISTER NO MORE STRONGLY than the MEMORY of a sharp word or an
unfriendly face.  By then she might be driving away on the road that
led-where?  To another terse young company director who would be
fascinated for a time by witchlike innocence?  Greenleaf WONDERED as
he drew his lips from her powderedless cheek.
     "Good-bye, Tamsin," he said.

No lamps were lit but the china still showed dim gleams from the last
of the light.  At first he THOUGHT the room must be empty.  The
stillness about the whole place was uncanny.  Nothing moved.  Then he
saw between the wing and the arm of a chair that had its back to the
window a sliver of white sleeve and he KNEW Marvell must be sitting
there.
     He knocked at the back door.

In the grate-the absurd pretty grate that shone like black silver-was
a pile of charred paper.  Greenleaf KNEW without having to ask that
Marvell had been burning his manuscript.
     "I came earlier," he said.

He began to feel sick, but not afraid, not at all afraid.  His eyes
met Marvell's and because he couldn't BEAR to look into the light blue
ones, steady, mocking, unfathomably sad, he took off his glasses and
began polishing them against hid lapel.
     "You KNOW, don't you?  Yes, I can see that you KNOW." 
     Hazily, myopically, Greenleaf felt for the chair and sat down on
the edge of it.  

     "Why?" he asked.  His voice sounded terribly loud until he
REALISED that they had been speaking in whispers.  "Why, Crispin?"

"That was the condition in the will."  The man's SURPRISE was real but
unlike Tamsin, he didn't laugh.  "You didn't KNOW?"
     "No, I didn't KNOW."
     "Then...?"
     "I WANTED more.  Can't you see, Max?"

He spread his arms wide as if he would take the whole room, the whole
house in his embrace.  "Tell me-I'm CURIOUS TO KNOW-what did she WANT
from me?"
     "Money."
     He sighed.
     "I THOUGHT I would KNOW love," he said.  "But, of course, I do
SEE.  That kind of sale is a woman's privilege."

     "Shall we have some light?"
     "I'd RATHER not," the doctor said.
     "Yes, I SUPPOSE you would FEEL THAT WAY.  I THINK that like Alice
I had better begin at the beginning, go on till I get to the end of my
world."

He paused for a moment and rubbed his eyes.  "Max, I told you the
truth and nothing but the truth, but I didn't tell you the whole
truth.  You KNOW THAT?"
     "You told me one lie."
     "Just one.  We'll leave that for the moment.  I said I'd begin at
the beginning but I don't KNOW where the beginning was.  Perhaps it
was last year when Tamsin was helping me extract the honey.

     "Yes, she told me."
     "Max, she didn't KNOW why the doctor had been sent for.  She
thought it was because Patrick was a spoiled brat.  She didn't KNOW
why the doctor had given him an injection, had stayed for hours.  But
at the time I was reading a book about allergies.  I was interested
because of that damned hay fever.  When she'd gone I looked up bee
stings and I FOUND why the doctor had stayed and what kind of
injection Patrick had had.  He must have been allergic to bee stings.
I didn't say anything to Tamsin.  I don't KNOW why not.  Perhaps, even
then...I don't KNOW Max."
     "Some people grow up out of allergies," Greenleaf said.
     "I KNOW that too.  But if it didn't come off, who would KNOW?"
     "It didn't come off."

"It began with the picture.  I don't KNOW this part-I'm only
guessing-but I THINK that when Tamsin was offered the picture things
were all right between her and Patrick, as right as they ever were.
Of course she KNEW he'd hated it when he was a child but she THOUGHT
he'd grown out of that."

     "When it arrived," Greenleaf said slowly, "she must have been
trying to patch things up between them.  He might THINK she'd sent for
it to annoy him, so she had it put in her room, a room he never went
into."

     "I saw it-and, Max, I told them about it in all innocence!"

"I was sick of the temptation.  I don't KNOW how I got down those
stairs."
     "I remember," Greenleaf said.

"It doesn't mean that in the text.  It doesn't mean that Macbeth was
looking with a child's MEMORY, but only in a childish way.  I suppose
it was my SUBCONSCIOUS that gave it that meaning.  I KNEW that Patrick
feared it because of what happened when he \fIwas\fR a child.  Then
the wasps got him.  Even then I couldn't SEE my opportunity.  I wasn't
SURE of Tamsin.  I'd never made love to her.  For all I KNEW I was
just an old pedagogue to her, a domestic science teacher.  At midnight
she came into my orchard."

     "It doesn't matter."
     "I FELT-I felt suddenly as if I was going to faint."  From shock?
From fear?  Greenleaf WONDERED with dismay if for months now Marvell
hadn't been getting enough to eat."

     When the lamp was lit Marvell put his hands round it.  They had
the opacity age brings and the THOUGHT CAME to Greenleaf that had his
son's hands covered that incandescence the light would have seeped
through them as through red panes.
     "It all happened as I've told you," Marvell went on, "except that
I didn't say no to Tamsin.  I told her I'd walk back with her but that
I'd left my jacket in the orchard."

     "When we got to the Hallows I went in with her.  She'd told me
you'd given Patrick a sedative and we both KNEW I was going to stay
with her.  We didn't say it but we KNEW.  She DIDN'T WANT to look at
Patrick and she went to take a shower.  While she was in the bathroom
and I could hear the water running I went into Patrick's room.  I
still wasn't SURE the sting wouldn't wake him.
     "There was a big pincushion on the dressing-table."

"I had to stay and see that she didn't go into that room.  She hated
Patrick but I don't THINK she would have stood by and let him die."
he stood up straight and in the half-dark he was young again.
 
His shoulders bowed as if to receive age like a cloak.  "At the time I
THOUGHT it a pretty conceit.  I should have REMEMBERED, Max, That they
might both UNDERSTAND the desires of old men.  I THOUGHT it was love."
     He sat on the table edge and swung his legs.

"The dog came upstairs and I shut her in with Tamsin.
    "Perhaps I was vain, Max, perhaps I THOUGHT I had a kind of
\fIdroit de seigneur\fR, perhaps I'm just old-fashioned.  You see, I
THOUGHT that still MEANT something to a woman, that she would have to
marry me.  When she made it plain she didn't WANT me, I felt-My God!
She'd WANTED me before, but I'm fifty and she's twenty-seven.  I
THOUGHT..."  
     "Crispin, I \fIdo\fR SEE."  It was more horrible than Greenleaf
had thought it could be.

"Please don't.  I never WANTED to..."
     "But it was only money, always money."

"Why tell me so much?"  He felt angry, but his ANGRY was a tiny spark
in the FIRE OF HIS OTHER EMOTIONS:  amazement, pity and a kind of
grief.  "You led me into this.  You made me SUSPECT."  He spread his
hands, then gripped the chair arms.
     Marvell said calmly:  "Naturally, I INTENDED to get away with it
at first."  His face was a gentle blank.  He might have been
describing to the doctor his methods of pruning of fruit tree.  "But
when I KNEW that I had killed Patrick in vain, for nothing, I WANTED-I
SUPPOSE I WANTED to salvage something from the waste.  They say
criminals are vain."  With a kind of wonder he said:  "I \fIam\fR a
criminal.  My God, I hadn't THOUGHT of it like that before.  I don't
THINK it was that sort of vanity.  All the moves in the game, they
seemed like a puzzle.  I THOUGHT a doctor and only a doctor could
solve it.  That's why I picked on you, Max."

Then he withdrew his hand.
     "I MEANT to try to get you interested.  Then Nancy started it all
off for me.  I've always THOUGHT hatred was such an uncivilised thing,
but I really hated Tamsin.  When you SUSPECTED her I thought, to hell
with Tamsin!"  He raised his eyebrows and he smiled.  "If it had come
to it, perhaps...I don't THINK I could have let her suffer for what I
did."
Then he withdrew his hand.
     "I MEANT to try to get you interested.  Then Nancy started it all
off for me.  I've always THOUGHT hatred was such an uncivilised thing,
but I really hated Tamsin.  When you SUSPECTED her I thought, to hell
with Tamsin!"  He raised his eyebrows and he smiled.  "If it had come
to it, perhaps...I don't THINK I could have let her suffer for what I
did."
     "Didn't you THINK what it would mean if I FOUND out?"
     Marvell moved to the fireplace and taking a match from the box on
the mantelpiece struck it and dropped it among charred sheets of the
manuscript.  A single spiraling flame rose and illuminated his face.
     "Max," he said, "I had nothing to HOPE for.  I've had a fine
life, a good life.  You KNOW, I've always THOUGHT that was the true end
of man, tilling the soil, husbanding the fruits of the soil, making
wonderful things from a jar of honey, a basket of rose petals.  In the
evenings I wrote about the things of the past, I talked to people who
REMEMBERED like me the days before taxes and death duties took away
almost everything that made life for people like me a kind of-a kind
of golden dream.  Oh, I KNOW it was a dream.  I wasn't a particularly
useful member of society but I wasn't a drag on society either."

"My summer ended when Glide told me about this house.  That's what I
MEANT when I said the bright day was done and I was for the dark."  As
the flame died he turned from the fireplace and clasping his hands
behind his back looked down at Greenleaf.
     "I don't KNOW what to do," the doctor said.  It was the phrase of
despair, the sentence desperate people used to him from the other side
of the consulting room table.

"You're not a priest hearing confession."
     "I WISH," Greenleaf said, a world of bitterness making his voice
uneven, "I WISH I'd kept to it when I said I didn't WANT to hear."
     "I shouldn't have made you."

"I'm not a policeman."  How many times had he SAID that in the past
weeks?  Or had he in fact SAID IT ONLY TO HIMSELF IN A REPETITIVE
refrain that irritated his days and curled itself around his sleep?
     Marvell hesitated.
  
     The garden was a paradise of sweet scents.  At first Greenleaf
was to BEMUSED, TOO STUNNED for THOUGHTS.  He moved across the grass
watching his own shadow going before him, black on the silvered grass.

No shadow moved across it.  I must leave him in peace, Greenleaf
THOUGHT, for a few more minutes.  He has lived alone, loving
loneliness, and he may never be alone again.

No sound came.  Suddenly as he stood, looking down at the strip of
light between door and floor, he THOUGHT of another house, another
bathroom where Tamsin had showered her slim body while her lover gave
to Patrick the sting that was his own individual brand of death.
     He paced the narrow passage, sickness churning his belly and
rising into his throat.

He banged on the heavy old door with hands so numb and nerveless that
they seemed no part of his tense body.
     In a film or play he would have put his shoulder to that door and
it would have yielded like cardboard, but he KNEW without trying how
impossible it was for him to attempt to shift this two-inch thick
chunk of oak.  Instead he groped his way back, WONDERING what that
noise was that pumped and throbbed in the darkness.  When he reached
the open air he REALISED that it was the beating of his own heart.
     He had to make himself look through that lighted window, pulling
his hands from his eyes as a man pulls back curtains onto an unwelcome
day.

He almost looked round.  Then he KNEW that it was he who had sobbed.
He took off his jacket, struggling with it as a man struggles with
clothes in a dream, and wrapped it around his fist and arm.

He lifted the slack arms and saw first the slashes on the wrists, then
the cut-throat razor lying beneath the translucent red water.
Greenleaf knew no history but there CAME TO HIM as he held the dead
hands THE MEMORY of a lecture by the professor of Forensic Medicine.
The Romans, he had said, took death in this way, letting out life into
warm water.  What had Marvell said?  "I am Antony still" and "Max,
forgive me."
     Greenleaf touched nothing more although he would have LIKED TO
drain the bath and cover the body.  He unlocked the door, carrying the
lamp with him, and left Marvell in the darkness he had chosen.

As he came to Shalom a taxi passed him, women waved, and Walter
Miller's face, brown as a conker, grinned at him from under a pink
straw hat.  Home to Linchester, home to autumn, home to the biggest
sensation they had ever KNOWN...
     Bernice opened the door before he could get his key out.
