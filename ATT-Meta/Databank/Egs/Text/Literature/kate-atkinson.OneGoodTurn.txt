p.312:

They [the bus Jackson was on, and a pink van in the lane next to them]
were at a red traffic light and when it chaged to amber the van moved
off. Jackson wasn't thinking anything much at the time except for `you
don't see many pink vans', but a semi-conscious part of his brain read
the words emblazoned on the side panel of the van in black lettering --
`Favours -- We Do What You Want Us To Do!' and another semi-conscious
part of his brain dredged up the little pink card [with the same slogan
on it] that had been in the dead girl's bra yesterday.
[NP]
The two sem-conscious parts of Jackson's brain finally communicated with
each other. This was a slower process than it used to be -- Jackson
imagined signal flags rather than high-speed broadband. One day, he
supposed, the different parts of his brain would find they were unable
to interpret the messages. Flags waving helplessly in the wind. And that
would be it. Senility. [EP]
