The Rector's Wife - Joanna Trollope
U.K.: Corgi Books (Black Swan ed.), 1993

p.68
On the fourth day he was off sick, and Mr. Mulgrove asked Anna if she
thought she could manage, and to ask Heather on flours and dried fruits if
she wasn't sure of anything.  She said she would be fine.  Indeed, to have
a whole morning undisturbed by any thoughts profounder than wondering why
on earth the people of Woodborough should consume so much tandoori curry
powder, while ignoring pesto sauce, was quite luxurious.  But Colonel
Richardson came between Ana and the tandoori curry powder; personable,
kindly, inflexible colonel Richardson, who had sat in her insufficiently
tidy sitting room in his beautiful old tweed jacket, and had said to her
that she was harming her husband, the community and the Church.  She had
explained to him about Flora, thinking that his undoubtedly benevolent
heart would be touched.

p. 178
Later, on the last bus to Loxford, Luke's mind returned reluctantly to the
subject.  He wasn't much surprised, since his mind, just at present,
lurched between the disagreeblness of home, and sex.  Sex usually won.
Luke was horrified and fascinated to find how much he thought about it and
longed for it and was afraid of it.  He couldn't see, usually how he was
actually going to do it for the first time but he feared that if that first
time wasn't soon he'd probably explode.  This state of affairs had come
upon him quite suddenly and he was entirely at its mercy.

And yet... There was some little haunting thing about his mother that sang
in Luke's mind.  Ever since she'd come back from Oxford, she'd seemed
secret, shut away, but the secret clearly wasn't a thrill like the secret
of Alison it was something said, as if something had got broken.   Luke
didn't want to talk about it because he didn't really think he could cope
with being confided in, but the look of her made him uneasy and sorry.

p. 203
She was perfectly certain that she would continue to go to bed with
Jonathan and that her love for him would grow unti she looked at Peter's
surpliced back before the alter - until she saw unquestionably what she
should do next.  For the moment, she would just gratefully draw strength
from this astonishing new source.  A thought shot into her mind like a bolt
from the blue.  had Jonathan actually been offered to her?

p. 209
He did not really see it, any more than he saw the sky beyond it, or the
greyish stone window that framed it.  He was conscious of very little
except the quiet and his unhappiness, which filled his whole being like
cold, still water.  It was water he was afraid to disturb, to dive into
because he couldn't bear even to begin to analyze why he felt as he did.
He shrank from his thougths, just as these days, he shrank from Anna.  If
their limbs brushed each other in bed, he could feel his withdrawing,
flinching.  In the same way, his eyes turned away from meeting hers when
they spoke.  He was terribly afraid that he was going mad.  Long ago, as a
theology student, he had had a crisis about prayer, a period of alarming
doubt.  His tutor, a man of enormous experience in ministerial matters, had
simply counselled him not to struggle.

p. 211.
A small light was dawning in Peter's comprehension.  he said quietly t Mrs
Maxwell, 'Please don't worry.  Don't think of it.'

p. 225
In her bag, she carried the plastic badge she had worn, the badge which
said, 'I'm Anna.  Can I help you?'  Glancing up at the sky; behind whose
high summer clouds dwelt that inscrutable power whose presence she could
not quite get out of her mind, she thought of her badge and its slogan, and
said to herself:  It wouldn't hurt You to wear one...

p. 229
Daniel and Jonathan Byrne sat in Daniel's study.  They had not put any
lamps on, because the light was fading so beautifully outside the window
that it seemed a pity to outshine it.  Miss Lambe had given them coleslaw
for supper, and Daniel was revolving in his mind how to tell her tactfully
that he found coleslaw disgusting.  He thought he might say that it gave
him indigestion (it didn't; nothing did) because that would let them both
out so easily.  Caring for the tenderness of Miss Lambe's feelings - as
small and vulnerable as seedlings - was becoming an exhausting and
full-time job.

p. 235
After Ella had gone, Peter went into the sitting-room and sat carefully on
the sofa.  He sat there for a long time, slipping his thoughts through his
mind like the beads on a rosary.  One thing was very plain and that was
that he wasn't at all surprised; indeed, he felt almost relieved to know
the key to Anna's extraodrinary behaviour recently. What was more, knowing
the key, being in power by possessing his new knowledge, made him feel, for
the first time in months, curiously elated.  He looked around the room,
reduced once more to its habitual untidiness, and found he even wanted to
smile.  It was such a relief, such a violent, savage, unspeakable relief to
know that he hadn't imagined things after all, that his revulsionfrom Anna
had been instinctive - rightly instinctive - and that he wasn't, oh, joys
of joys, going off his head.  His unconscious mind had known what his
conscious mind had refused to know.  In a curious way, he felt himself to
be free, as if shackles had fallen from him.  He found that he was
trembling.


Duncton Wood - William Horwood

p. 70
Bracken's mind was in a whirl-the prayer had left him feeling very strange
and, as far as he was concerned, it hung magically in the air about them,
making everything beyond it seem dim and unclear.  He felt lost in his
thoughts, literally lost, for he couldn't find where among them he actually
was.  The old mole crouched before him as if he were one of the trees, or a
plant growing or th soil, part of the whole thing that seemed around him
contained in the prayer.  He was finally dragged-that's what it felt
like-out of these thoughts by Hulver, who asked him in a gentle voice, 'Why
have you come over to the slopes, can you tell me that?'  Bracken started
to tell him, explaining how he was interested in the system, liked
exploring and . . . and soon he was telling Hulver everything.

p. 71
For a while Bracken crouched in the night alone, wondering about Hulver and
enjoying the unusual calm and peace he felt.  A snatch of the grace Hulver
had spoken came back to him and he let its words run through his tired mind
like the sound of the breeze in the long grass by the edge of the wood:

P. 76
Hulver, too, was affected by their meeting.  She seemed so, so . . . so
alive!  Eager, and sighing, standing and crouching, sad, loving.  'Elder
meetings never start on time, anyway, he thought to himself, settling down
comfortably by her as a sign that he would talk for a little at least.
'I'll tell you about Rebecca, your namesake, if you like, Rebecca the
Healer of the Ancient System.'

But Hulver himself didn't know what he was going to say, since it all came
into his mind and out as words without him seeming to have too much to do
with it.  He felt very peaceful.  'Most of the stories you've heard are
nonsense, I'm sure; harmless nonesense, of course.  It's just that we all
like a good tale and if there seems to be a gap in the telling of it, we
fill it up with something we like to think might have been--and who knows,
it might have been!'

p. 90
Often on a dark night he had tossed and turned over in his mind why he, of
all his generation, was still alive after six Longest Nights.  Six!  He
shuddered at the number.  Hwen the long moleyears of winter had given way
finally to the earliest stirrings of spring, the worst time came when the
air was chill as ice an dhe knew he would not mate.  Often, then, he would
go to sleep in his burrow and wish that he might not wake up.

p. 194
'Last bloody time I find worms for a female, I can tell yer that', he
muttered angrily as he hurled three worms down before her in the tunnel
where she lay.  Rune noted this remark down in his memory.  He didn't trust
moles who lost their tempers over something as trivial as that, or even
lost their tempers at all.

p. 200
His gait was suddenly heavy and ponderous and he felt tired.  Tired and
old.  It was true that in his confrontation with the owl image he had,
finally, lost all sense of physical fear, though Mandrake lived in too
great a haze of anger and confusion to know the fact.  But when a mole
loses such fear, the freedom he finds may serve only to make him prey to
the darker, more perilous fears that lurk beyond all moles' bodies and
inhabit their minds.

p. 201
Such a thought was so far from his mind--indeed, it was so far from his
experience--that it quite took his breath away.  He saw that she was small
and bedraggled and seemed very frightened, while he (and he looked at the
now much glossier fur above his paws and felt the much more powerful
muscles that had developed since he had started to regain his strength) was
fit and well and must seem confident.  Why, he was an adult, and a male,
and strong!

p. 203
As for the sights he had seen in the Ancient System, and the sounds he had
heard, there was something about them that warned him to keep them secret.
Some things, especially when a mole does not understand them, are best
honoured by being kept secret in the heart rather than scattered to the
winds as words.

p. 210
With her fourth dawn away from Barrow Vale, the dew was thick on the
pastures and Rebecca woke in the temporary burrow she had made near them,
feeling at one with the change that now moved so excitedly about her,
rather than just a delighted observer of it.  From its first moment, the
day seemed to carry her along so that she surrendered to its will and did
whatever it seemed to want.  She was as hungry as ever on waking, but this
put no urgency at all into her stretching and grooming, which became a
timeless exercise in self-content.  Time did not matter.  Eventually, her
coat glossy and her eyes happy, she burrowed about for food before taking
to the surface to see the day.  And the day seemed so free with itself that
it almost asked that she should break free from the grass of the wood's
edge and go out on to the fresh pastures, the cool dew catching her paws
and belly.

p. 211
The light morning breeze coming up the pastures carried their scent to
where Rebecca crouched.  The scent was male and new:  strong and exciting.
It was distand enought for her to want to run out towards it, to increase
the chance that the  males--though she did not know there were two of
them--might scent her out.  And run she did, or rather she danced across
the dew-covered grass towards where the shadow stopped and the sun started,
the male scent fresh like new-cropped grass, different from Duncton scents.
As she danced, she did not even think of the risk she was taking, or how
dangerous it would have seemed to most Duncton moles.

p. 237
He waited int he burrow, tending and scratches and woulds he had received
in his fight with Rune and feeling lost.  He wanted to see her again, if
only to confirm that shw had not been a dream--though, he thought ruefully,
his wounds from Rune were evidence enough that she was not.

p. 241
'You mean Rebecca?'  Asked Mandrake, enraged but fascinated at the same
time.  With each word that Rune now spoke a picture of his Rebecca, his
daughter Rebecca, his untouched child, hardened on the edge of his mind
where nomole at first like to look, but to which a jealous mole manyu
easily be drawn.  A picture of fur and darkness, of moving hauches and
talon scratches on backs, of moist snouts long and pointed and open mouths,
and white teeth and sensual smiles in the dark of a forbidden burrow.  And
his Rebecca among them.  His daughter!

p. 245
When one or other of the two great males hit the side of the entrance, the
whole burrow shook and earth flew, as Rebecca watched them, at first
helpless and confused.  As she did so, a powerful and unwanted excitement
ran through her, a forbidden and obscene excitement that she tried to blot
from her mind:  the excitement of seeing the two huge males, both of whom
she loved, fighting for her.

p. 278
It took him two long hours to find his way back again, and then only with
the greates skill and patience as he marked each turn and thought carefully
back to the twists and turns he could remember.

p. 288
It had stood massive, awe-inspiring and, somehow, safe, and he had looked
up at it, as the elders did their chanting, and all had faded away from his
mind but its size and majesty, and his sense that he was part of it.  In
the many moleyears since, he had only ever thought of hte Stone as a
distant thing, for the sense of grace that flowed into him then was
overshadowed by the fighting and living, and the mating, that was the
reality of Duncton in his time.

p. 296
Mekkins was touched by the change that had come over Curlew herself since
Rebecca, and then Comfrey, had come.  They seemed to have put new life into
her and the mole he remembered as being so frightened and withdrawn was now
bustling with activity and full of purpose.  'Things certainly work out in
a strange way', he thought to himself as he departed, and that was
something to take comfort from. When he got back to the march End and
heared what had been happening in the system, he realised how right Rose
had been to warn that dark days were coming.  They were already there.  For
fear and terror were takin gDuncton over, as the henchmoles, manly
Westsiders, were beginning to get so powerful that they were out of
control.

p. 312
'It's Longest Night!'  thought Mekkins to himself, filled suddenly with a
sense of its joyous mystery and witnessing for himself the power of the
Stone to make moles see each other. 'It's Longest Night!'  Involuntarily he
began to sind a little song to himself and wander around the clearing to
get a view of the Stone on the side that was lit by the moon.

p. 313
He answered with  amrshe End ditty, and Rebecca started to laugh with a
hint of the old freedom Mekkins had thought he would never hear again, the
laughter that put hope into a mole's heart.  But it was deeper and quieter
than it had once been.  She stopped suddenly and turned again to Bracken
and just looked at him.  And he looked at her.  'Why, she understands!'  he
was thinking.  'He knows!' she said to herself.

p. 334
Mandrake's massive body moved uncomfortably in the dark, his own dark,
aching with the lifelong effort of seeing beyond the whirling blizzard in
his mind and failing, always  not seeing, but remembering that he might
have, with Sarah, who surely could hear him calling when he took her and he
tried to say something but his body and the darkness wouldn't let him.
Yes, she heard him calling out of the blizzard, oh Sarah, she hard him out
of the Siabod ice.  He membered that.  Or was it Rebecca?  With Rebecca.
On and in Rebecca when she heard him . . . yes, she did!  She heard him.
'Where is she now?  Wher is she?'

p. 253
For a moment Rebecca dn Bracken stared across the burrow at each omer and
the light that seemed to have gone from them shone again, and time was not
important.  'Why, it's there and always will be', thought Rebecca, knowing
it was true.

p. 361
Despite his overt weakness he seemed quite unafraid, although a semblance
of fear--very like that he had shown before the other mole--would sometimes
cross his face.  Bracken soom realised that his was a guise, a kind of mask
he wore to appear so pathetic that nomole would wish t persist in
attacking.  'Perhaps that's why he's managed to survive', thought Bracken,
whose only knowledge of crippled moles was that they never survived their
first summer because they could not get territory of their own.

p. 398
They talked about a thousand things, but what Rose most put into Rebecca's
mind were seeds of thougth to grow, rather than finished plants to fade.
And she waited for Rebecca to ask the questions.

p. 412
'Impossible!'  Mullion was thinking
'Oh, no, it's not', thought Bracken.  And then, 'Oh no, you don't!'  as
Mullion started angrily towards the old mole.  But he got up, turned his
snout o Mullion, seemed suddenly more powerful than anything Bracken had
ever seen in his life, and without so much as flexing a talon, brought
Mullion to a respecful halt.

At this, both Bracken and Mullion started with surprise.  'Stonecrop!'
thought Bracken.  'Stonecrop.  Brother of Cairn.  Known too Rebecca.  So
that was why...'

p. 418
Experience like this also taught Bracken to appreciate that a fight between
moles is not, at root, a physical thing at all, but a spiritual
confrontation.  The very idea of spirit was a new one to him and he only
learned of it in himself by being made to observe it in other moles.
Mullion for example, had a friendly, weak spirit with no 'hardness' or
'force' to it, and it ws only when Bracken himself sensed this that he
understood Medlar's immediate rejection of Mullion as a fighter.

Bracken found that Stondcrip, on the other hand, had a very hard and
powerful spirti, though on ethat was inflexible and therefore, in Medlar's
terms, fairly easy to get round.  In his own mind, Bracken came to
understand this by thinking of Stoncrop as a series of burrows and tunnels,
not unlike the Barow Vale, where, if a mole kept his head an dspirit firm,
he would eventually find a way through.  It was understanding this that
cleared Bracken of his fear of Stonecrop--and simultaneously made Stonecrop
more respectful of Bracken.

p. 429
Rune decided that the time had come to launch a limited assault on the
pastures.  It was with this objective in mind that he started to gather his
henchmoles on the Westside at the end of May.

p. 431
He had a dozen things in his mind to say, but they all fell away before her
still gaze and he said what was in his heart:  'What are we going tto do,
Rebecca?'  She came forward and touched him for a second, a touch that
reassured him, a nd then she led the way back to Rose's tunnels where,
without another workd, they sealed the tunnels together, soil falling on
their fur as with burrowing sweeps of their paws they retreated before it.
It was the Pasture way of doing things.

There was so much she didn't know and so many things she wished she had
asked.  So she would be a healer and for the time being she would stay
here, fo there was nowhere else she could go--certainly not to Dunction,
not yet.  It was Brome's turn to sense what was in her mind, for he came
nearer aher and crouched quietly, his big limbs stretched comfortably by
the untidy seal of soil they had just made as he said:  'It will be all
right here, you know.  THere are many moles that will need you'

p. 439
As Brome watched her leave, he thought to himself that there were times
when she spoke with the same mysterious certainty Rose had sometimes had.
As if she saw a world he could not see and there were no words to describe
the realities within it.  yet as she left along, how vulnerable she seemed,
and for the first time he saw very clearly how much in need of protection
she really was.


p. 559
'Stuff this', thought Bracken to himself, now thoroushly annoyed and
resisting the impulse to attack the scribemole.  He turned back the way he
had come, nodding his head as if in agreement with the scribemole and
thinking that rather than have a confrontation he would simply find some
other way past the chamber.  THe thought turned into action as soon as he
got back to the tunnel down which the two scribmoles who had ignored him
had gone.

p. 572
For his part, Skeat was quite as confused, for a Holy Mole is, as he
himself had always said, only another mole at heart.  What Bracken had
done, or seemed to have done, had appalled him as nothing had ever in his
life appalled him before.  He had run through the tunnels, round to this
second viewing point, the sound of the song echoing in his ears and the
picture of the intruding Bracken in his mind, but with what intent he had
no idea.

p. 578
A mole must live where a Stone has put her, or him, and with those moled
who happen by circumstance or fate to be living in the same system.  And
nomole was more aware than Rebecca, healer now to the system of Duncton,
that hopes and memories are like winter aconite, a source of health and joy
if used on way, a debilitating poison if used another.  So, as the summer
advanced, she put her Bracken from her mind and concentrated all her
energies on helping the moles about her.

p. 604
The thought hung about them, each considering it in a different way.  For
Boswell the answer was as simple and as peaceful as sitting still; for
Bracken, who had seen plentyof suffering in his own time, it was a questin
he had never been able to answer.  For Bran, it was not much worth thinking
about.  They could not tell what Celyn thought at all.

p. 619
Truly the Stone was wise to have bound me to Bracken' thought Boswekk,
following with something near a rueful grin.

p. 636
The first think Bracken noticed about Rebecca was that she was with litter,
and not his litter.  The second was that she was not the mole, the
ficitious female, he had created in his imagination i the long moleyears of
their separation.    This was not the mole he had prayed for, whose memory
had comforted him, whose caress had become in his mind like the music of
water or wind.  SHe was tired, she was older, she was worried.

p. 637
But there was an air of distruct about Bracken's contact with Rebecca which
put an impassible barrier between them so that, although both ached for an
expression of love, neither knw how it could be given.  The fact that she
was with litter made him angry and turned and twisted in his mind and put a
barrier of suspucion and jealousy before his eyes.
