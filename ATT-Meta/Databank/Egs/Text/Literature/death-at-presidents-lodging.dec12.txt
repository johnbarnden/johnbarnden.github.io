From Michael Innes, "Death at The President's Lodging" 
======================================================
Penguin Books, 1988

[a detective novel]

pp.21/22: 

[NP] Briefly Dodd [a policeman] explained. No one had taken
much care of his key. A key is not at all the same thing to a scholar
that it is to a banker, a doctor or a business man [sic]. The possessions of
the learned classes are locked up for the most part in their heads and
to a don a key is more often than not something that he discovers
himself to have lost when he wants to open a suitcase.


p.39: 

[The Dean] Mr. Deighton-Clerk's gaze went slowly up to the ceiling
[where there were depictions of the twelve signs of the zodiac], as if
seeking comfort in his own private astrological heaven. Comfort came to
him in some measure as his eye moved from __Cancer__ to the taut form of
__Sagittarius__.  He had taken energetic action. And was it not (but
here the thought floated only in the remoter regions of the Dean's
brain)---was it not the capacity for energetic action that was called in
question when the possible preferment of a mere scholar was canvassed?
At this moment the Dean's eye, voyaging still among his rafters, rested
on __Aquarius__, ...


p.202:

[NP] Appleby [Scotland Yard detective hero] turned to another paper
[notes on someone called Pownall]. "Here's Pownall," he said, "according
to the story he gave me this morning. He got back to his rooms in Little
Fellows' a little before nine-thirty. ... "



p.212:

[NP] "And no one rang up?"
[NP] "No one."
[NP] Vain persistence [in asking the questions], thought Appleby, and
was rising to take his leave when something, the echo perhaps of a
faintly perceptible tension in the last word spoken, prompted him to
add one last query.


p.212:

In the mind with which he was grappling he sensed, in this moment,
calculation more intense than he had hitherto had any feeling of.  ...
And the moment, Appleby's temporarily ungoverned intuition asserted, was
the cardinal moment in the St. Anthony's case ...
