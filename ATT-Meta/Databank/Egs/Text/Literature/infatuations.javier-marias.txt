From "The Infatuations" by Javier Marias
========================================
London: Penguin Books, 2014.
Translated from the Spanish by Margaret Jull Costa.


p.157:

A part of Diaz-Varela must have longed every day for his bosom pal to
die, to vanish, and that same part, or an even larger part perhaps,
would have rejoiced at the news of his unexpected death by stabbing, a
death with which he would have had nothing to do.

{CONTEXT:  The bosom pal is Deverne, and Diaz-Varela loves his wife.}

{ORTHOGRAPHIC NOTE:  "Marias" and "Diaz-Varela": have acute accent on the "i".}
