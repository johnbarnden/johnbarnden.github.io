p.99:

[NP] I said all these things [to my son Charlie] - ... - but only a tiny
part of me was there with my son. My brain was like a well-occupied
household, activity taking place simultaneously in each of its many
rooms.


p.319/320: 

[NP] [p.319:] `Hang on,' I said, under my breath, ... `Wait.'
[NP] [p.320:] Something had crept into my brain, a tiny wisp, like
fog. What? I stared at the darkly glinting sea and tried to catch
it. Yes: something about so many people coming to the beach that it was
hard to keep track. Who'd said that? Who'd just said that?


p.392: 

As I turned into Maitland Road [on my bicycle], I was about to swing my
leg over the cross-bar. I was forty-five seconds from a hot shower and
in my mind I was already off the bike and indoors, after six hours in
the saddle, when a car door opened into the road in front of me, ... and
I hit it.[EP]
