I found the following phrases in dictionaries regarding "mouth" & "words".


"put words into someone's mouth"  :  (2 entries)
  1.  to represent, often inaccurately, what someone has said;
  2.  to tell someone what to say 
                             ref: Collins English Dictionary 
                                  (under entry  "mouth" )

  Apparently, you have a strong intuition of the first meaning  while I
  have had  always believe it to have the second meaning.



I also found this phrase, just imagine someone pulling out a string of words
directly from your mouth, before they could be vocalized.

"take the words out of someone's mouth"  :  
      to say exactly what another person was about to say.
                             ref: Webster's College Dictionary 
                                  (under entry  "word" )

I would like to clarify the meaning of "facet"

Does it implies distinct, disjoint (disjunct)  surfaces/regions/subparts ?

"different facets of his personality" - implying that each of these aspects
                         of his personality being very dissimilar ?

"thousands of facets of the compound eyes of a fly " -  implying that each of
               these miniature eyes provides a distinct cone of vision?

"the facets of the brilliant cut" - implying that each of these polished faces
               refract and reflect different beam of light that contributes to
               the shining appearence of the gem stone?

Thanks v. much.

Yes, for words/mouth I asumed teh first meaning, although I suppose Iha
suitable context might force me to take the 2nd meaning.

The "take .. out .. mouth" phrase is very common.


Facets: I agree with your interpretations, except that in the personality case,
I wouldn't say that the aspects have to be dissimilar in any sense that implies
contradiction or conflict. It's more that they're just separate aspects. E.g,
one aspect of my own personality is that I don't like watching sports programs,
and another aspect is that I find cooking relaxing.
