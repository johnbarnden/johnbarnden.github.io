Some examples from:

Gentner, D. & Grudin, R. (1985).
The evolution of mental metaphors in psychology: A 90-year perspective.
American Psychologist, 40 (2), pp.181--192.


p.182: [William James, 1905]:

   -- ``an idea encountering a resisting idea'' 
   -- ``an idea moving under its own momentum''
   -- ``ideas overcoming an obstacle''

p.182: [William James, 1905]:
   -- ``my ideas have no prevision of the whole of [my plan]''
              {animate-being metaphor: homunculus special case}

p.184: [Dewey, 1894]: 

   -- ``through lying, the mind grows wary or strong from swimming against the stream''
              {animate-being metaphor}


p.184: [Arnold, 1945]: 
   -- disturbance of thought is likened to
      ``shortcircuiting too large an amount of excitation''
              {neural metaphor}

p.184: {spatial metaphor}:
   -- ``[thoughts] on or below the sensory surface'' [Woodworth, 1915]
   -- thoughts as ``things active against a background of consciousness'' [Strong, 1894]

p.185: [James, 1905]:
   -- ``anything hiding in the background is not mental activity''  {spatial metaphor}
   -- ``a body moves in empty space by its own momentum as when our thoughts wander at their own sweet will'' {systems metaphor [why?]}


p.190: [James, 1905]:
  Metaphor of animal driver with yoked animals:
  ``long-span activities''  are described a ``yoking'', ``encouraging'' and ``sterring'' ``short-span activities''.
