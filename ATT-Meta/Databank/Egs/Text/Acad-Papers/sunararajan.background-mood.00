Passage on pp.232-233:

   [NP] "Decoupling" in Focusing does not imply disconnection,
   however. Probably the term "loosely coupled" would be more
   appropriate in describing "the Focusing attitude of being separate
   from, but in caring relationship to" one's own emotions ... This
   caring relationship to one's own emotions is nicely summed up by
   Cornell as follows: "Focusing is like being a friend to your own
   inner experience. The qualities of true friendship include
   acknowledging, allowing, patience, curiosity, respect, warmth,
   welcome, empathy, compassion, and love" ... A better definition of
   "affect tolerance" cannot be found. The importance of affect
   tolerance ... is very well recognized in Focusing: "The inner climate
   of __letting it inwardly be__ is necessary for inner change"
   ... Again techniques abound to cultivate this "inner climate": "We
   are not in a hurry. We create an inner atmosphere of no pressure,
   just being with what's there. We ask gentle questions as a way of
   inviting the feeling to tell us more" ... The comportment of affect
   tolerance is also referred to as "receiving" ..., or "a welcoming
   presence": "A welcoming presence means you are interested in
   everything you become aware of inside. A welcoming presence gives
   [each feeling] the space to be and breathe, evolve and transform"
   ... Thus the therapist's response, as a way of modeling "affect
   tolerance" to the client who complained of "Still all I feel is
   tense" ... was "OK, so let's welcome that" ... [EP]
