Xin Wang is actually me.

{Said by Prof. Xin Yao at a committee meeting (Research Students
Monitoring Group), School of Computer Science, University of Birmingham,
in Nov. 2005, concerning the composition of a "thesis group" committee
for a research student called Xin Wang. Each thesis group contains an
"RSMG monitor". The monitor for Xin Wang was actually Xin Yao, hence the
statement above, but the document incorrectly stated that it was someone
else.}
