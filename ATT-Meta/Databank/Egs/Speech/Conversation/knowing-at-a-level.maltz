Before I forget, I want to relate something Robert Maltz said
yesterday.  He was talking about how he had had all the symptoms of
hepatitis and how he knew all the symptoms of hepatitis, but it had
taken him three weeks to "conclude" that he had hepatitis.  Anyway, at
one point, he said, "At one level, I knew all the symptoms of
hepatitis."  But, presumably, either not at the level at which he knew
his own symptoms, or not at the level where facts get put together.

Which makes me think of the mind-as-computer metaphor.  With that kind
of metaphor, I would think the inference about drawing conclusions
would be extremely disfavored.  Lots of stuff is in a computer
"memory", but unless it gets "worked on" by the consciousness
"program", no conclusions are drawn.  Of course, it may depend on what
kind of "program" you think the person in question is running...
