A couple of days ago Alison and I were doing a crossword puzzle together
and at one point she said after deciding that one answer we had put in
was wrong:

	Something had been tugging at the back of my mind for a while
                       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Is that one you have seen before?

To me it suggests a young child trying to persuade its parent to go in
a different direction by pulling a hand or jacket, etc.
