During MS Prospectus Meeting in Psychology Department, 
New Mexico State University, 2 Feb 1996.

Doug Gillan said: ``I may have (* PLANTED THAT IDEA IN MARK'S HEAD.*)''

NOTES:

-- Gillan works on metaphor in computer interfaces.

-- The sentence may well *not* appeal to the horticultural notion of planting,
but rather to the type of plantin occurring in ``planting evidence'' somewhere.
