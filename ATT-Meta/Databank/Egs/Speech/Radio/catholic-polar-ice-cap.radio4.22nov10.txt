From the "Today" programme, BBC Radio 4 (UK)
============================================
Monday 22 November 2010,
in "Thought for the Day" segment of the programme
approx 7.49am

speaker: Clifford Longley, Catholic commentator

re: Pope's recent statement that it's OK to use condoms in some
restricted cases, e.g. to help prevent AIDS spread.

Longley said:

  "From today, the entire polar ice-cap of Catholic sexual morality has
    started to melt."

{Longley went on to claim that the Pope has made a fundamental shift in
how to reason about sexual morality: from natural law to humanizing of
sexuality, and from insistence on ideal behaviour to case-by-case
reasoning.}
