Peter Mandelson [former aide to Tony Blair]:

"That was a storm in an eggcup -- it didn't even make the size of a teacup."

[Wording is from memory, but size comparison and allusion to "storm in a
teacup" is accurate. "Make" is used in sense of "reach". "That" refers
to a contentious political situation.]
