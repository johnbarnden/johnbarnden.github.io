{Heard in discussion of England's bid to host the football World Cup in
2018, and allegations by the UK media about corruption about within the
FIFA board - FIFA being the organization deciding between the bids.}

"England's bid is now worried about the impact of an investigation into
FIFA by the BBC's Panorama."

{Panorama = a TV programme doing investigative journalism}

{NB: There's an organization called England 2018 that's in charge of the
bid. So possible analysis is: England's bid links metonymically to
England 2018, which in turn links metonymically to the people within
England 2018.}
