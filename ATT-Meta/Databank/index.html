<H2> Purpose </H2>

The databank mainly contains real-discourse examples of <STRONG>metaphorical</STRONG> descriptions
of mental states and processes. It also contains some examples of the use of 
<A HREF=Metaphor-Descriptions/metonymy.html> metonymy</A> in mental
state descriptions.

<P>
<HR>
<BR>

<H2> Metaphors and Manifestations </H2>

In this databank, a metaphor is taken to be a conceptual view of some type of
thing as some other type of thing, for example of the mind as a physical
space. A metaphor is <I>NOT</I> a chunk of language (sentence, phrase, or
whatever).  Rather, a metaphor is ``manifested'' in a chunk of language.


<P>
<HR>
<BR>

<H2> Size of Databank </H2>

The databank currently contains about 1100 text examples and 65 or
more (transcribed) speech examples. These numbers include repetitions
arising when examples manifest more than one metaphor.


<P>
<HR>
<BR>

<H2> Overall Structure </H2>

The (metaphorical) examples in the databank are categorized
according to the metaphors they manifest. Mostly, for a given metaphor, there is a page
including examples of its use and a page describing the metaphor itself.
(However, some metaphors are lumped together.)

<P> There is also a page for examples of metonymy and a page describing
metonymy.

<P>
Most examples have a link to a file identifying the
source of the example and sometimes containing a fuller version of the example,
or more context.  

<P>
Some links can only be followed by people at our location. These include
the ones where the link contains "&lt;jab N&gt;" or "&lt;atmet N&gt;"
for some number N. If you wish to know the source and context in such a
case, please contact me.

<H2> Coverage </H2>

The databank comes with no claims to completeness: 

<UL>
<LI>
The metaphors in it are just ones that happen to have been noticed in the
ATT-Meta research.  There may be important metaphors that are not represented.

<P>
<I>
However, please note that the fact that your favourite metaphor is not listed
in the Table of Contents doesn't mean there aren't manifestations of it under
other headings. Please consult me if you'd like guidance on finding something.
</I>

<P>

<LI>
There is no claim that all examples of metaphors of mind have
been extracted from any given text/speech source cited in the databank. The
databank can NOT generally be used for calculating statistics such as the
frequency of particular metaphors of mind in text or speech.
<P>

<LI>
Transcriptions of speech examples do not include indications of pauses,
prosody, overalpping, etc. They do contain imaginative punctuation.

<P> I am always on the lookout for new examples of the usage of metaphors of
mind, and of the use of metonymy in describing mental states.  If you would
like to contribute some examples, I would be most grateful, and would of course
acknowledge you in the databank unless you asked me not to.
