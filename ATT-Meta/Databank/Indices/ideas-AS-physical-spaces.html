Entering the bedroom, (* SHE HAD PLUNGED INTO AN UNCOMFORTABLE, DREAM-LIKE
CONDITION THAT ENCUMBERED HER LIKE AN OLD-FASHIONED DIVING SUIT IN DEEP
WATER.*) Her thoughts did not seem her own -- (* they were piped down to her,
thoughts instead of oxygen.*)

{NB Example included here in that the dream-like state can be counted as
a sort of thnking, and the diving suit provides a physical space. But
example also inlcuded in IDEAS AS EXTERNAL ENTITIES - not sure which
type of metaphor is more appropriate here or whether both are.}
<BR> 
{NB also: extension of the diving-suit idea, by viewing thoughts as piped down.}

... (* he paced restlessly about INSIDE HIS DESIRE, LIKE A
PRISONER IN HIS DUNGEON.*) (* A perpetual anguish stifled him.*)
