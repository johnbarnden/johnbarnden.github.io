Once the (* fear *..) took hold, I was fucked. I'd never known anything
like it could exist: (..* all-consuming, ravenous, A WHIRLING BLACK
VORTEX THAT SUCKED ME UNDER so completely and mercilessly that it truly
felt like I was being devoured alive, bones splintered, marrow
sucked.*..) After an eternity ... something would happen to (..* BREAK
THE VORTEX'S HOLD -- a nurse coming in ... -- and I WOULD CLAMBER UP OUT
OF IT, shaky and weak as a half-drowned animal. But even when the fear
receded for a while, it was always there: DARK, MISSHAPEN, TALONED,
HANGING SOMEWHERE ABOVE AND BEHIND ME, WAITING FOR ITS NEXT MOMENT TO
DROP ON MY BACK AND DIG IN DEEP.*)

Furthermore, learning to play this type of game helps one develop skills such
as flexibility and an (* ORIENTATION TOWARD *) independent achievement.

When my son Matthew taught me the game, I completely (* MISSED *) the aspect
of spatial integration.  I treated the mazes as if they were independent,
unaware that they were linked in the third dimension through stairs.  I even (*
MISSED *) the connections between mazes on the same level and did not realize
that to leave a maze by the same door by which I entered was to go backward to
an earlier maze instead of advancing to a new one.
