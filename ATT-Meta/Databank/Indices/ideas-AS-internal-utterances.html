<I> Don't be scared, not of monsters, not of witches, not of big dogs.</I> 
And now, snapping loud from every
direction: <I>Be scared, you have to be scared,</I> ordering like this is
your one absolute duty. Be scared you're fat, ... Be scared to walk on
your own, ... Be scared of wearing the wrong stuff, saying the wrong
thing, ... Be scared of strangers. ... Be scared you won't do well
enough in your examinations, ... Be scared terrified petrified that
everything you are is every kind of wrong. Good girl.*)

Her main instinct is to grab hold of Selena, probably literally, and ask
her what the fuck she thinks she's doing; but (* some other instinct,
further back and twisting restlessly, TELLS HER THAT *) the moment she
says this out loud -- to Selena, or to Holly or Becca -- nothing will
never be the same again. (* She can smell the poison smoke as everything
they've got roars into flame.*)

[Lucy is climbing the stairs, with effort.] (* For years and years,
PANTED Lucy -- HER VERY THOUGHTS CAME IN GASPS -- Vera lived up here

{Unusual use of a physically-mannered speech verb ("panted") in a
thought report. She is thinking while literally panting and gasping
(this is confirmed by the context -- see the text). At the same time her
thoughts are presumably effortful and (therefore?) effortful. So the
panting and gasping may be both literal and metaphorical (so: a
"twice-meaningful" metaphor). arguably, it's not just that she was
thinking in the time-slices between the pants/gasps. NB also the
embedding of a metaphor within the thought - the view of Vera's mind as
animate.}

(* Why should a thing like that (* [A RHYMING COUPLET] rise now to the surface
of her mind and float round on it, while all the noble verse she had
read and enjoyed, ... , was nowhere to be found, not a shred of it, in
any corner of her brain?  [NP] What a brain, THOUGHT Miss Entwhistle,
disgusted, ..., her eyes shut; what a contemptible, anaemic brain,
deserting her like this, only able to throw up to the surface when
stirred, out of all the store of splendid stuff put so assiduously into
it during years and years of life, COUPLETS.*) *) ... (* A last couplet floated
through her brain *) -- her brain seemed to clutch at it[.] (* Now where did

{NB nesting of IDEAS AS INTERNAL UTTERANCES and other metaphorical
elements within cases of IDEAS AS INTERNAL UTTERANCES. E.g., ``Why
should ... corner of her brain'' is a reported thought of Miss E, but this
thought itself casts the idea of the rhyming couplet rising to the
surface of her mind etc.}

"aloud" suggests that without that the blurting *could* easily be taken to be internal and
purely mental.}

Again techniques abound to cultivate this "inner climate": "We are not
in a hurry. ...  (* WE ASK GENTLE QUESTIONS AS A WAY OF INVITING *) the
feeling to tell us more" ... The comportment of affect tolerance is also
referred to as "receiving" ..., or "(* a welcoming presence*)": "... A
(* welcoming presence *) gives [each feeling] the space to be and breathe,
evolve and transform" ... Thus the therapist's response ... to the
client who complained of "Still all I feel is tense" ... was "OK, so
