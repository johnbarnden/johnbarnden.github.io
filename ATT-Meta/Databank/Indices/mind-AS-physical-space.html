Behind the newspaper (* Julian WAS WITHDRAWING INTO THE INNER COMPARTMENT
OF HIS MIND WHERE HE SPENT MOST OF HIS TIME. THIS WAS A KIND OF MENTAL
BUBBLE IN WHICH HE ESTABLISHED HIMSELF when he could not bear to be
A PART OF WHAT WAS GOING ON AROUND HIM. FROM IT HE COULD SEE OUT and
judge but in it he was SAFE FROM ANY KIND OF PENETRATION FROM
WITHOUT. IT WAS THE ONLY PLACE WHERE HE FELT FREE of the general idiocy
of his fellows. His mother HAD NEVER ENTERED IT BUT FROM IT HE COULD
SEE HER WITH ABSOLUTE CLARITY.*)

<BR>
{Several interesting complications:
<BR>
(1) The compartment/bubble is not only a subregion of the mind-space but
is also felt as a subregion of real physical space.
<BR>
(2) Provisionally, there is mixing with MIND PARTS AS PERSONS [OR OTHER
ANIMATE BEINGS], in that what's in the bubble is really his conscious
self, viewed as a person in a compartment. However, there is no other
mind-part viewed as a person, so perhaps the mixing is better analysed
as being with MIND AS ANIMATE BEING [OR LIVING BODY], the animate being in this case being a
person.
<BR>
(3) The visual aspect is probably partly metaphorical - Julian can "see"
his mother and other aspects of his environment from within the bubble
in the sense  of understanding them, not (or not just) literally seeing them.
