INHABITED every space of it in her slow breathing. She was in the
puckered ceiling plaster ..., in the red plastic of the chairs, in the
electric wires within the walls and in the throat pulse of every man
and woman. She breathed and felt the synagogue inhale and exhale with
her.

DWELLING WITHIN THE CONGREGATION, she noted the familiar soup of thought
and emotion. There were angers here, bitter hatreds, fear and boredom
and resentment and guilt and sorrow. SHE SAW HERSELF FROM OUTSIDE

appears so strange to all these others? SHE SAW HERSELF THROUGH A DOZEN
PAIRS OF EYES, each one registering her oddness with fear or disgust or
confusion. She smiled at the people AS SHE PASSED THROUGH THEM, saying,
ah yes, you think I'm strange. But I know something you don't know.

Even today, many conservatives have a compulsion for ideological
saliva-testing, and Quayle has sometimes betrayed an unnerving (* TASTE *) for
moderation.

Last Tuesday the nation, too, again said clearly that it is comfortable with
divided government.  That means permanent partisan conflict between two
branches of government claiming contradictory mandates.  Government rarely
works well this way, but today, when representative government is gridlocked,
it is, in one sense, succeeding: it is faithfully representing (* THE
CONTRADICTION IN THE ELECTORATE'S MIND.*)

Some gifts are so obviously bad-intentioned that the message is hardly
hidden at all.  As psychotherapist Linda Barbanel points out, "Gifts
can convey:  `I'm mad as hell at you.'  That's tough to say out loud,
so the message is delivered instead through a hostile gift."

Dr. Piaget notes that "Some gifts say `I don't think you're worth a lot.'

Gifts between spouses deliver potent messages.  "Every present has an element
of the unconscious in it," says Linda Barbanel, MSW, a New York City
psychotherapist.  "It could (* SAY *) 'I love you,' or I want you to love me,'
but it could also (* ANNOUNCE *) 'Here's what I really think about you.'  A
good gift should (* SAY *) I'm paying attention- I hear you,'" explains
Barbanel.  "It should demonstrate that the giver has thought about the
receiver."  Howard's and Jim's gifts both (* SPOKE ABOUT *) their own desires.
