<H2> DESCRIPTION OF METAPHOR:</H2>
<H2> Ideas as External Entities </H2>

<P> Under this metaphor, an agent's ideas, thoughts, hopes, desires, images,
etc., or events of the agent thinking, imagining, hoping, desiring, etc., are
portrayed as being in a physical space outside the agent.  The ideas (etc.) are
often cast as concrete physical objects. They can move around, or be active in
other ways, and the agent can move relative to the ideas, or physically
manipulate an idea (as in ``grasping'' an idea).

<P> The ``external entities'' are often, or usually, physical objects or events.

<P> The physical space in the above  description may or may not be the real physical
space surrounding the agent. For the former cases, it's possible that a more
refined analysis would see a second metaphor, called something like Mind as
External Physical Space, mixed in with Ideas as External Entities.

<P> Note that an interaction with ANOTHER agent's ideas would not come
under this metaphor, even though those ideas are external to the agent
in focus.

<P> (I used to call the metaphor Mind Within Physical Space. I feel  the
current name is better.)

<H4> OVERLAPS WITH:</H4>
<H4> <A HREF=cognizing-AS-physically-sensing.html> Cognizing as Physically Sensing </A></H4>

An agent's interactions with the alleged external ideas, under Ideas as
External Entities, generally involve the agent in physically sensing those
ideas (whether through vision, touch, hearing, or whatever).  However,
Cognizing as Physically Sensing merely overlaps with Ideas as External Entities
because in other manifestations of the former what is physically sensed is not
(allegedly) an entity external to the agent.

<H4> OFTEN MIXED WITH:</H4>
<H4> <A HREF=ideas-AS-physical-objects.html> Ideas as Physical Objects</A></H4>

<H4> NOTES on OTHER POSSIBLE MIXES: </H4>

<P>

<P> A complication is that Ideas as External Entities  and <A
HREF=mind-AS-physical-space.html> Mind As Physical Space</A> are not always
easy to distinguish, and it seems that they are sometimes mixed in the
following way: the agent A's mind is viewed as a physical space, M, and one of
the entities in it is the agent's conscious self, S. Given that S can itself be
viewed metaphorically as an agent, we then have an application of Ideas as
External Entities to S mixed with an application of Mind as Physical Space to
A, coordinated with each other in that the ``physical space'' for the
applications of both metaphors is the same.

<P> Also, under Mind As Physical Space, mental entities such as ideas can be
portrayed as moving in and out of that space. The question then arises of where
they are, if anywhere, when not in the space: IF they're to be thought of as in
the space surrounding the agent, then we also have an instance of Ideas as
External Entities. (But that's a big IF.)
