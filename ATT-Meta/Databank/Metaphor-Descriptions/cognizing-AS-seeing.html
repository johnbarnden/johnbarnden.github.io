<H2> DESCRIPTION OF METAPHOR:</H2>
<H2> Cognizing as Seeing </H2>

<P> 
Under this metaphor, thinking, believing, understanding, or other cognitive
activities/states are portrayed as seeing (or ability to see).

<P>
This is an extremely common metaphor, and is manifested most simply and palely
in phrases like ``see that [something is the case].'' It may be tempting to
regard ``see that'' as a frozen manifestation of the metaphor.  However, the
phrase can be productively and systematically varied in ways that suggest the
metaphor is live even here. Consider, for example: ``he could only see in a
blurred way that ....''

<P>
Other common phrases or words manifesting the metaphor include: see as, see
how, see through, in [one's] view, view as, regard, looks like, look to, look forward
to, shortsighted, lose sight of, blind to, focus on, outlook, viewpoint, flash
of insight, flicker of recognition, bright, brilliant, having an eye toward.

<P> One particular, common way in which the metaphor is manifested is in
casting visual images as pictures, diagrams, etc. It is common in ordinary
language to talk of ``picturing'' things or of having ``pictures'' of objects
or situations in one's mind.

<A HREF=cognizing-AS-interacting-w-nonownmental-entities.html>    Cognizing as Interacting with Non-Own-Mental Entities </A>
<BR>
<A HREF=ideas-AS-physical-objects.html>       Ideas as Physical Objects </A>


<P> In many manifestations of Cognizing as Seeing, the seen items are often
non-mental items of some sort, such as external situations. In that case, the
manifestations are also manifestations of Cognizing as Interacting with
Non-Own-Mental Entities.

<P>
On the other hand, in other manifestations of Cognizing as Seeing, the seen
objects are mental objects (or things that are arguably mental objects, such as
problems and solutions to problems). In this case, the manifestations are also
manifestations of Ideas as Physical Objects. (Under that metaphor, of
course, the point is that the relevant cognizing is a physical interaction with
or relationship to the ``physical'' objects.)

<P>
<HR>

<H4> OFTEN MIXED WITH:</H4>
<A HREF=mind-AS-physical-space.html>                     Mind as Physical Space </A>

<P> In a common special case of the situation in which the seen objects are
mental objects, those objects are within the agent's mind, conceived of as a
physical space. We therefore have mixing with Mind as Physical Space.  When a
mind is viewed as a physical space, visual perception can play an important
role within that space. If the agent cannot ``see'' something within the mind
``space'', then the agent is not conscious of it. Something which is in the
focus of the agent's ``vision'' seen is in the focus of his/her
consciousness. Something in a ``dark'' part of the mind might be visible, but
only dimly, and is therefore not prominent to consciousness.  A ``flash'' of
insight is strongly present to consciousness because sudden and bright.
