<H2> DESCRIPTION OF METAPHOR:</H2>
<H2> Cognizing as Interacting with Non-Own-Mental Entities </H2>

<P> Consider the sentence 

<PRE>
             Take birthdays. One family may trot out party favors, ...
</PRE>

<P> [= <A
HREF=../Indices/cognizing-AS-interacting-w-nonownmental-entities.html#BIRTHDAYS>
example</A> from databank].  Here the agent is cast as interacting
(physically) with entities, namely birthdays, that are not amongst his/her
own mental entities.  We therefore have a <B>contrast</B> with <A
HREF=ideas-AS-external-entities.html>Ideas as External Entities</A>,
under which, for instance, the agent might ``grasp'' or otherwise
interact with a
<B>mental</B> entity.

<P> (However, I am tentative about saying that ``take X'' sentences manifest
Cognizing as Interacting with Non-Own-Mental Entities. It is possible that the X in
``take X'' should be analyzed as a metonymic reference to an idea of X, so that
we would have a mixture of <A HREF=metonymy.html>metonymy</A> and Ideas as
External Entities.)

<P>
Note that the entities interacted with may themselves be mental, if
belonging to another person, as in ``drinking in her soul.''

<P> For another type of sentence I tentatively suggest as manifesting the
metaphor of Cognizing as Interacting with Non-Own-Mental Entities, consider 

<PRE>
             To me, feminism has backfired against women.
</PRE>

<P>
[= <A HREF=../Indices/cognizing-AS-interacting-w-nonownmental-entities.html#FEMINISM>example</A> 
from databank].  I suggest that the backfire situation is cast as an
entity which is physically ``directed towards'' the agent (``me''). For convenience, I
include such directedness as a case of ``interaction'' very broadly construed.

<P> Somewhat similarly, a ``for'' phrase can be used instead of a ``to''
phrase, as in 

<PRE>
             For conservatives, today's military success compounds a paradox.
</PRE>

<P>
[= <A HREF=../Indices/cognizing-AS-interacting-w-nonownmental-entities.html#CONSERVATIVES>example</A> 
from databank]. 



<P> My comments about ``to X'' and ``for X'' sentences are in at least rough
accord with the account of mental-state sentences in Langacker (1990:
especially pp.222-226, 233-234), although he does not claim that such sentences
are metaphorical.
