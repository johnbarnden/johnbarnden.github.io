<H2> DESCRIPTION OF METAPHOR:</H2>
<H2> Mind Parts as Persons or other Animate Beings </H2>


<P> Under this metaphor, a person's mind is viewed as having ``parts'' that are
themselves people (or other animate beings) having their own thoughts, hopes,
emotions, and so forth. We can call these parts ``inner persons.''  Different
inner persons can have conflicting mental states, or a mental state held by one
can fail to be held by another.  In addition, the inner persons can communicate
in ordinary language with each other or to the overall agent.

<P>
For convenience, I also let the metaphor cover a view where the parts are
merely viewed as minds in their own right, rather than as complete animate beings.

<P>
It need not be the case that any one inner person is more important or has
control over the others. However, a special case is when one of the inner
persons is the agent's central self.

<P>
In some manifestations of the metaphor, one of the mind-parts is a special
component of the mind that has long-term existence and a special nature, such
as the agent's central self, or the agent's memory.  However, in may
manifestations the parts do not have any special nature and might well be very
short-lived (merely concocted for the purposes of the discourse in which the
metaphor is manifested).

<P>
The metaphor is <I>NOT</I> confined to describing agents who suffer from
multiple-personality disorders or other pathological conditions.


<P>
<HR>
<H4> QUASI-SPECIAL-CASE OF: </H4>
<H4> <A HREF=mind-AS-physical-space.html> Mind as Physical Space  </A></H4>

The inner persons are viewed as being within the agent's mind, metaphorically
viewed as a physical space. In this sense the metaphor is a special case of
Mind as Physical Space.

<P>
Although manifestations of Mind Parts as Persons or other Animate Beings rarely
mention a specific location of an inner person, there is an implicit positional
factor of great significance: the inner persons are often taken to be in verbal
communication with each other, so that presumably they are assumed to be in
relatively close physical proximity.

<P>
<HR>
<H4> OFTEN MIXED WITH:</H4>
<H4> <A HREF=ideas-AS-internal-utterances.html> Ideas as Internal Utterances  </A></H4>

The inner persons are often cast as engaging in natural language communication.
The ``utterances'' they make are internal ones, so in this way the metaphor is
mixed with Ideas as Internal Utterances.
