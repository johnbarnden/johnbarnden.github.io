<H2> DESCRIPTION OF METAPHOR:</H2>
<H2> Ideas as Physical Spaces </H2>

<P>
Under this metaphor, ideas, thoughts, hopes, desires, images, emotions,
feelings, etc., or <I>events</I> of thinking, imagining, hoping, desiring,
feeling, etc., are viewed as physical spaces (or things such as
containers whose Modus Ponens aspect in context is the space inside).

<P>
The spaces may be, but need not be, viewed as being within the agent's
mind, when this is metaphorically viewed as a physical space.

<P>
Equally, they may be, but need not be, viewed as being within the real space
surrounding the agent.
