<H2> DESCRIPTION OF METAPHOR:</H2>
<H2> Ideas as Internal Utterances </H2>

<P> This metaphor casts a thinking event as an event of ``internal speech.''
Internal speech is not <I> literally</I> speech.  An example manifestation of
the metaphor is ``Sally said to herself that Mike was untrustworthy,'' prvoided
that this is in a context that implies that Sally did not say the utterance to
herself out loud.

<P> That example uses a speech verb, and no speech verb seems to be barred from
being used to describe an internal-speech event. For instance, one <A
HREF=../Indices/ideas-AS-internal-utterances.html#WHISPER1>example</A> in the databank uses the word
``whisper.''

<P> A modifier like ``to herself'' is not needed if it is clear from context
that a thought is being reported.

<P> The use of a speech verb is not necessary for the metaphor to be
manifested. For instance, the sentence
<BR>
<PRE>
       Sally thought, ``Mike's untrustworthy''
</PRE>
manifests the metaphor.

<P> 
It is also common, especially in fiction, for speech-like thoughts to be portrayed
in much more implicit ways, without even the use of a mental-state  verb let alone a
speech verb.  See, for instance, Cohn (1978).

<H4> OFTEN MIXED WITH:</H4>
<H4> <A HREF=mind-parts-AS-persons.html> Mind Parts as Persons or other Animate Beings</A></H4>

The sentence 
<PRE>
      Part of Sally was saying, ``Mike's untrustworthy''
</PRE>
illustrates this mixing, in that the utterances of an inner person are thoughts
of the the overall agent.
Also, a sentence like 
<PRE>
      Sally said to herself that Mike was untrustworthy
</PRE>
can (in many contexts) be taken to illustrate the mixing: one part of Sally
is saying something to another part.

<H4> SPECIAL CASE OF:</H4>
<H4> <A HREF=mind-AS-physical-space.html> Mind as Physical Space </A></H4>

In that real utterances are localized in space, it seems reasonable to say that
Ideas as Internal Utterances is a special case of Mind as Physical Space. 

<P>
However, most manifestations of Ideas as Internal Utterances do not locate the
utterances at particular places in the mind ``space'' or cast the utterances as
moving around. An expecially vivid <A
HREF=../Indices/ideas-AS-internal-utterances.html#MURMUR1>exception </A> occurs in the
database.

<H4> NOTES: </H4>

People often
consciously experience internal speech, but not all manifestations of
Ideas as Internal Utterances should be taken to portray such a situation.
Rather, there may in fact be two metaphors at work: one metaphorical step is in
describing a thought as if it were consciously experienced internal speech
(even though it isn't really); the other step is in the metaphorical
relationship of internal speech to real speech.
 
<P>
The large majority of manifestations I have seen of the metaphor involve
internal speech as opposed to writing.  But the databank does contain examples involving

<A HREF=../Indices/ideas-AS-internal-utterances.html#WRITING1>writing</A>, 

<A HREF=../Indices/ideas-AS-internal-utterances.html#WRITING2>jotting</A>, 

<A HREF=../Indices/ideas-AS-internal-utterances.html#WRITING3>etching</A> and 

<A HREF=../Indices/ideas-AS-internal-utterances.html#WRITING4>engraving</A>.

<P> Also, sometimes the type of utterance (speech vs. writing) is not
clarified.
