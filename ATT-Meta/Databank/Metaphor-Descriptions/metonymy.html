<H1> METONYMY (in mental-state descriptions and elsewhere </H1>

<P> NOTE: The databank contains a page for examples of metonymy.  Examples of
metonymy also occur in other example-pages, and are so marked by the tag
``METONYMY''.

<P> NOTE:  Towards the end this page discusses metaphor as well as metonymy.
See the comments on <A HREF=#M4COMPETE>competing metaphorical explanations</A>
and <A HREF=#MIX>metonymy/metaphor mixes</A> below.

<H2>NATURE OF METONYMY </H2>

I adopt the interpretation of the term ``metonymy'' that is common in AI and
elsewhere: <I>viz</I>, a phrase P is a metonymic reference to something (or
things) X when the literal reference of P is to something (or things) Y, where
Y has, in context, a salient connection to X.

<P> The connection can be of a standard type that often occurs in discourse,
e.g., that of physical containment (as in ``he drank (* THE WHOLE BOTTLE
*)''), or it can be idiosyncratic to the current discourse or discourse
situation, as in saying ``put that button in the (* RED *) box'', meaning the
box that is for collecting red buttons. Here P is ``red'', Y is the
property of being red, and X is, idiosyncratically, the property of being for
collecting buttons that are red. (However, see an alternative possible
style of analysis <A HREF=#TREPI>below</A>.)

<P> Although in the adopted view of metonymy the phrase P can be of any
syntactic type, most examples in the databank (just as in the literature
on metonymy) have P being a noun phrase.

<P> As is fairly standard, I name a metonymy according to the following scheme:
Y-TYPE FOR X-TYPE.  Example: Container FOR Contained.

<H2>TWO TYPES OF METONYMY FOR MENTAL STATES</H2>

Two main types of metonymy are represented in the databank:-

<H4> Entity FOR Idea of it </H4>

For a sentence like <A NAME=BURGLAR></A>``The burglar was in Sally's mind all day long,''
it is reasonable to suggest that the phrase ``The burglar'' is being used
metonymically to refer to some idea of the burglar. It is that idea that was in
Sally's mind, not the burglar him/herself! (... but see <A HREF=#BURGLARM4>below</A>).


<H4> People-Involving Entity FOR the People Involved </H4>

This is manifested in sentences like ``The U.S. believes that ...'', where the
U.S. is the people-involving entity.
Some of the main cases of a ``people-involving entity'' are as follows, together with
the sort of the people normally considered to be involved: 

<UL>
<LI>
a country:: leaders or members of the  population

<LI>
an institution (e.g., the Red Cross, the Army):: members or leaders 

<LI>
a board or committee:: members

<LI>
a newspaper:: editors or journalists

<LI>
a faction (e.g., the Left):: members or leaders

</UL>

<P> But there are many other possibilities. For instance, in one <A
HREF=../Indices/metonymy.html#ED-PAGE> example</A> in the databank we
find: ``[the] editorial page has always believed ...''.  Here we presumably
have a metonymic reference to the editors.

<P> Which particular people are implicitly referred to can be highly context
dependent.  For instance, in a sports news article the phrase ``the U.S.''
might refer metonymically to the members of the U.S. Olympic swimming team.
Also, the precise people involved cannot be inferred, often.

<P>
The examples in the databank use the metonymy in referring to the holders of
mental states, as in ``The U.S. believes that ...'' Of course, the metonymy
can also be used for other purposes, beyond the scope of the databank.

<P> For completeness, I also include some examples that use phrases such as
``the audience,'' even though I am not absolutely sure that metonymy is
involved.  My thinking is that ``the audience'' refers directly to a SET of
people, so that ``the audience believes that ... '', if taken literally, would
say that a set believes something. But only a person (or some other sort of
cognitive agent) can literally believe something. 

<P> On the other hand, if the
subject of ``believe'' is a plural noun phrase, such as ``some audience
members,'' then there is a direct reference to each individual member of some
set (in the example, some unknown subset of the audience).

<A NAME=M4COMPETE>
<H2> CAVEAT: COMPETING METAPHORICAL EXPLANATIONS </H2>

An alternative analysis of ``The U.S. believes that ...'' is that the country
is being metaphorically regarded as a cognitive agent. This account appears to
be less favoured in the literature than the metonymic analysis, so I have
classified such examples under Metonymy. But I believe that there is much to
recommend the metaphorical account.

<P>
My main reason for saying this is that it simplifies certain types of
inference.  For instance, if we are told that the U.S. believes that A is
better than B, and we are also told that the U.S. believes that B is better
than C, a plausible inference is that the U.S. believes that A is better than
C. (There is no need to decode the metaphorical statements into their
underlying real-world meanings in order to make this inference. By the way,
avoidance of such decoding in suitable circumstances is a cardinal principle of
the ATT-Meta project.) However, on the metonymic analysis, we have to take the
additional step of working out or assuming that the people involved in the A/B
belief are (at least roughly) the same as those involved in the B/C belief; and
then we would be faced with reasoning about the beliefs of a plurality of
people, which is at least marginally more elaborate than reasoning about a
single cognitive agent.

<P>
A quite different metaphorical analysis would be to take the verb ``believe''
metaphorically, while taking the phrase ``the U.S.'' literally.  It could be
that the situation being described is that the ``believed'' proposition is
contained in, or implied by, constitutional or legal articles, rather than that
members of the population or of the leadership actually believe the proposition.

<P>
In the sentence ``The editorial page has always believed that Z'' the analysis
might be that the daily occurrences of the editorial page have always contained
or implied Z, with no implication that the writers of the page have (ever)
actually believed P. [Thanks to David Farwell for this suggestion.]

<P>
My own preference between the two type of metaphorical analysis is for the
first one.

<P>
A relevant empirical study of real discourse can be found in Graham
Low's paper ` ``This paper thinks...'': Investigating the acceptability
of the metaphor AN ESSAY IS A PERSON', in L. Cameron & G. Low (Eds), <I>
Researching and Applying Metaphor,</I> pp.221-248, Cambridge University
Press. 

<P> <A NAME=BURGLARM4></A> Finally, in the burglar <A HREF=#BURGLAR>example</A>
above, a competing metaphorical analysis is that the mind is being viewed as a
physical space that contains the thought-about objects <I>themselves</I>, as opposed
to containing <I>ideas</I> of those objects. (This metaphor is not explicitly
represented in the databank. I mention it only as an interesting suggestion.)

<A NAME=MIX>
<H2>METONYMY/METAPHOR MIXES</H2>

The type of metonymy covered in the databank are often mixed with metaphor.
Most obviously, metonymies of the type People-Involving Entity FOR the People Involved
only affect how the agents of the mental state in question are being described,
rather than affecting how the mental state itself is described.  Whether the
latter description is metaphorical or not is largely independent of how the
agents are described. Thus, for example, we can get the following sort of
sentence:

<PRE>
          The Red Cross pushed this idea to one side.
</PRE>

<P> This mixes metonymy with the metaphor of 
<A HREF=ideas-AS-physical-objects.html>Ideas as Physical Objects</A> 
(and also either
<A HREF=mind-AS-physical-space.html>Mind as Physical Space</A>
or 
<A HREF=ideas-AS-external-entities.html>Ideas as External Entities</A>).

<P>
The metonymy of Thing FOR Idea of That Thing can also be mixed with metaphors of
mind.
As a variant of our burglar <A HREF=#BURGLAR>example</A> above, consider

<PRE>
          She pushed the burglar to one side of her mind.
</PRE>

<P>
This mixes the metonymy with the metaphors of
<A HREF=ideas-AS-physical-objects.html>Ideas as Physical Objects</A> 
and
<A HREF=mind-AS-physical-space.html>Mind as Physical Space</A>.

<A NAME=TREPI>
<H2>TRANSFERRED EPITHETS</H2>

An illustration of this phenomenon is the
use of "weary" in "weary road", where it is (some) people who use the
road who are weary. Clearly this could be analysed as a metonymy on
"weary", leading from the property of weariness to, say, the property of
tending to cause weariness in users. 

<P>
However, Barnden (2011) considers a more complex but perhaps sometimes
better explanation, namely that "weary" just has its normal literal
interpretation, but "road" has a double reference: (1) metonymically to
users of the road, (2) literally to the road itself. So the literal
meaning of "weary" qualifies the metonymic interpretation of "road", but
the reference of the whole noun phrase is to a road. This account is
less formally elegant than the one above but avoids the need for
abstruse connections between complex, rather artificial properties, and
therefore may qualify as being more cognitively plausible.

<P>
NB: Such an analysis could also apply to the "red box" example above.
