<H2> DESCRIPTION OF METAPHOR:</H2>
<H2> Emotional Mind as Physical Space  </H2>


<P>

<STRONG><FONT COLOR=RED>
This category has been abandoned, as of 19 March 2020. It has been
absorbed into  <A HREF=mind-AS-physical-space.html>MIND AS PHYSICAL
      SPACE</A>.
</FONT></STRONG>



<P> The category was like Mind as Physical
Space, except that it involved emotional rather than mental entities/events.

<P>
But I have never regarded emotional entities/events as strictly distinguishable from
mental ones. 
<BR>
Therefore, arbitrary categorization decisions were sometimes being
made about examples in the databank.
