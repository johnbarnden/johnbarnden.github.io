<H2> DESCRIPTION OF METAPHOR:</H2>
<H2> Mind as World-Definer </H2>

<P> In a typical manifestation of this metaphor, a belief (or other mental state) of an
agent X is reported by describing the situation that is believed or whetever
and adding a qualifier like ``in X's mind.''  For example, we might have  ``In
John's mind, terrorism is getting worse every day.''

<P> This is analogous to the use of qualifiers like ``in the novel,'' ``in the
movie'' and ``in the painting,'' where the ``in'' takes us into a fictional
world. We can call a novel, movie, play, painting, etc. a <I>WORLD-DEFINER</I>.
(Notice that this analogy plays an important role in Jackendoff (1983),
although Jackendoff does not think that a metaphor is involved.)

<P> Qualifiers like ``in his mind'' can indicate states such as planning (``He
was writing the letter in his mind'') or merely entertaining or imagining (``In
his mind, he was scoring goal after goal'').  Which state is conveyed is
delicately dependent on the nature of the target situation (e.g., terrorism
getting worse) and syntax.  On the question of syntax, compare the goal-scoring
example just given with ``He was scoring goal after goal in his mind.'' The
latter is more susceptible than the former to an interpretation in which the goal-scoring is a
metaphorical description of successful problem solving events, as opposed to
imagined sporting events.

<P>
Some manifestations of the metaphor explicitly refer to the defined
``world'' rather than using an ``in X's mind'' tag.  There is currently
only a small number of clear examples of this type in the databank
(noted in the examples page as involving "AGENT'S WORLD}", but the
phenomenon is more common than that fact implies.  Another possible
example is ``Mike lives in a world in which everyone is after him.''
This could in some contexts that everyone in Mike's real environment
(``world'') is indeed after Mike, but in other contexts it could mean
that Mike thinks that everyone is after him.

<H4> NOTES: </H4>

Not all uses of a tag like ``in his mind'' signal Mind as World-Definer.  In a
sentence like ``The embarrassment he had caused her was in John's mind all day
long'' the ``in John's mind'' tag is not being used adverbially to qualify a
situation description; instead, it is being used predicatively of something
(the embarrassment). I claim that the sentence actually manifests <A
HREF=mind-AS-physical-space.html>Mind as Physical Space</A>, and the phrase
``the embarrassment he had caused her'' is being used <A
HREF=metonymy.html>metonymically</A> to refer to some idea that John had of the
embarrassment.

<P>
This claim is backed up by the fact that we get natural variants of the
embarrassment example by referring to particular locations within the mind, for
instance by using ``in the back of John's mind'' in place of ``in John's
mind.''  Such localization is not natural for examples like the terrorism one
--- the sentence ``In the back of John's mind, terrorism is getting worse every
day'' sounds peculiar.

An obsolete name I have also used for the metaphor is <I>Ideas as Models. </I>
