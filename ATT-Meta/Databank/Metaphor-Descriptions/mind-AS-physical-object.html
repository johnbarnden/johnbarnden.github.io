<H2> DESCRIPTION OF METAPHOR:</H2>
<H2> Mind as Physical Object </H2>

<P> Under this metaphor, the mind is viewed as a physical object of some sort.
I distinguish it from <A HREF=mind-AS-physical-space.html>Mind as Physical
Space </A>.  I.e., for the purposes of this databank I do not regard a physical
region as a physical object.

<P> NOTE: this metaphor is represented in the databank in the pages for
``Mind as Physical Object -- Miscellaneous'' and ``Mind as Animate Being or
Living Body.''

<H4> ANOTHER IMPORTANT  SPECIAL CASE:</H4>
<B>Mind as Container </B>

<P>
This metaphor is discussed in the page for <A
HREF=mind-AS-physical-space.html>Mind as Physical Space</A>, for reasons
explained there.
