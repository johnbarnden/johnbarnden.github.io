<H2> DESCRIPTION OF METAPHOR:</H2>
<H2> Ideas as Physical Objects </H2>

<P>
Under this metaphor, ideas, thoughts, hopes, desires, images, emotions,
feelings, etc., or <I>events</I> of thinking, imagining, hoping, desiring,
feeling, etc., are viewed as physical objects. (Exception: when it is
the space within the object that is in focus, then the utterance is
categorized under Ideas as Physical Spaces.) 

<P>
The physical objects may be, but need not be, viewed as being within the agent's
mind, when this is metaphorically viewed as a physical space.

<P>
Equally, they may be, but need not be, viewed as being in the real space
surrounding the agent.

<P>
The physical objects can be of any sort, small, large, rigid, non-rigid,
liquid, animate, inanimate, etc. In particular, a mass of ideas is sometimes
viewed as a unit, and in that case it may be viewed as a body of fluid
(cf. ``flow of ideas'').
