<H4> ``Special-Case'' Relationship  </H4>

A metaphor M1 is a SPECIAL CASE of a metaphor M2 if manifestations of M1 are
also <I>ipso facto</I> manifestations of M2. For instance, <I>Cognizing as
Seeing</I> is a special case of <I>Cognizing as Physically Sensing.</I>

<P>

M1 is a QUASI SPECIAL CASE of M2 if there is some (variable) sense in which M1
is approximately a special case of M2. For instance, one possibility is that
most but not all manifestations of M1 are also manifestations of M2.

<H4> ``Overlap'' Relationship  </H4>


M1 OVERLAPS M2 if some special case of M1 is also a special case of M2.  For
instance, <I>Cognizing as Seeing</I> overlaps with <I>Ideas as
Physical Objects</I> because there is a special case of the former that could
be called <I>Cognizing as Seeing Mental Objects</I>, where the seen objects are
mental entities (e.g., ideas) that are simultaneously being viewed as physical
objects.

<P>
Obviously, a special-case relationship is also an overlap.

<H4> Mixed Metaphor </H4>

A metaphor M1 is MIXED with a metaphor M2 when some utterance uses a
combination of both to describe a state of mind. There are various ways such
mixing can happen. (I will add comments about this later.)

<P>

An utterance that is within the overlap of two metaphors also mixes those
metaphors.  
But there are other forms of mixing.
