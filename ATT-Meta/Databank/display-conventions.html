<H4> Databank Structure </H4>

<UL>

<LI> Each entry in the Table of Contents leads you to an EXAMPLE PAGE, which contains a
     list of examples, usually all manifesting a particular SINGLE METAPHOR.

<P> 

<LI> Most examples in the example pages are annotated with links of the form
      <I>[[Speech: source]]</I>, <I>[[Text: source]]</I> or <I>[[Text:
     source p. ...page numbers...]]</I>.  These links go to files
     identifying the sources of examples and often containing fuller
     versions of the examples.   

     <P> Some links can only be followed by people at our
     location. These include the ones where the link contains "&lt;jab
     N&gt;" or "&lt;atmet N&gt;" for some number N. If you wish to know
     the source and context in such a case, please contact me.


<!
  Links to HTML source files take you to the right place in the file. That place should be at the top of the display.

  When page numbers are included in the link to a plain-text source file, you may search that file for the page numbers.
        Sorry, but different source files may currently have different conventions for marking the page numbers.

<P> 

<LI> When metaphor M1 is a SPECIAL CASE of metaphor M2 (i.e., manifestations of
     the former are also manifestations of the latter), the examples for M1 are
     generally not included in the example page for M2.

<H4> Display Conventions in Examples </H4>

<UL>

<LI> The most important phrases in an example in the EXAMPLE page for a metaphor, from the point
      of view of exhibiting that particular  metaphor,  
      are  bracketed as follows: (* ... *). Note that:

   <P>

   <UL>
   <LI> Usually, the bracketed chunk has been put into upper case to aid visibility.

   <P>

   <LI> A lower-case chunk bracketed by (* ... *) is  usually  only of
        subordinate interest, and may not even manifest a metaphor (or
        metonymy). An exception is that in examples of <I>Ideas as
        Internal Utterances</I> the quoted ``speech'', if any, is not usually put into upper case.

   <P>

   <LI> Sometimes a bracketed chunk is best thought of as a continuation of the previous one.
        In that case, the previous one ends  with *..) and the current one starts with (..*

   </UL>

      
<P>

<! Many source files also use the (* ... *) bracketing convention for the
most important metaphor-manifesting phrases. However, some source files use
other conventions, such as simply having the phrases in upper case.

In plain-text source files, italicized segments in the original source are marked
     as follows: __the segment__[ital]
>

<LI> [NP] means new paragraph in the original text (or end of paragraph, though 
     sometimes [EP] is used instead to indicate a paragraph end). But
     ...

    <P>
    Eventually the HTML paragraph break symbol &lt;P&gt; started
    to be used instead of NP and EP.

<P>
<LI> Don't be surprised to see annotations that look obscure. For instance,
there are many that say ``zeugma-avoidance.'' Such annotations date from when
the databank was a private resource. I'd be happy to explain them on request.
