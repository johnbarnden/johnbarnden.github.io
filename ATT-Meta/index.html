<H2>Metaphor and Metonymy</H2>

<P> This project mainly concerns metaphor-based reasoning for metaphor
understanding.

<P> The project also became intensely concerned also with
metonymy and particularly with the contentious issue of the relationship
of metaphor to metonymy. That issue was the origin of one of two main avenues
of investigation in the Leverhulme Trust
project (2010-2013) cited below, which is part of the overall ATT-Meta project.

<P>
A reasoning system called ATT-Meta has been implemented as a partial
realization of theoretical principles developed in the project. The
system performs some of the reasoning needed for understanding
metaphorical utterances.  The system does not currently take natural
language input.  Rather, it is given logical expressions that are
simplified representations of the contents of small, hypothetical
discourse fragments.


<H2>Mental States</H2>

<P>
A special concern in the project is the metaphorical (and metonymic)
description of mental states, and with other interactions of
metaphor/metonymy with mental states. These issues were central in the
second main avenue of investigation in the Leverhulme Trust project (2010-2013) cited below.

<P>
The ATT-Meta system performs both ordinary and metaphor-based reasoning
about mental states. On the ordinary side, the central approach in
ATT-Meta to reasoning about mental states is ``simulative''
reasoning. This is fully combined with non-simulative reasoning about
mental states.

<P>
ATT-Meta can reason about nested belief states (X believes that Y
doesn't believe that Z believes that ...) to any depth of nesting.

<P> In the Leverhulme Trust project, the following main interactions
between figurative language and mental states are at issue:

<UL>
<LI>
The interpretation of metaphor embedded in propositional attitude
reports (mental state reports): that is, the interpretation of
propositional attitude reports where what is believed, intended, etc. is
metaphorically couched.

<LI>
The possible implicit metaphorical conception of inner mental states in a
nested mental-state situation (possibly portrayed by a nested
propositional attitude report), as a way out of problems with existing
theories of mental state representation and report interpretation.

<LI> Reasoning about the alleged mental states of a non-cognitive entity
that is metaphorically cast as a cognitive agent (as in "My car doesn't
want to go out today").

</UL>




<H2>Uncertain and Graded Reasoning Framework</H2>

All of ATT-Meta's reasoning is done within a general-purpose rule-based
framework for uncertain reasoning, which has no particular orientation
towards mental states or metaphor.  Uncertainty is expressed by means of
qualitative certainty levels.

<P>
The system also has a simple, qualitative approach to gradedness of
states of affairs (e.g. John liking Mary to a medium degree). The
approach is based on a  discrete scale of qualitative degrees.

<P>
ATT-Meta is distinctive in its thorough integration of belief reasoning
and uncertainty, allowing the system to model agents doing uncertain
reasoning about other agents' uncertain reasoning.

<P>
ATT-Meta is also distinctive in its detailed preoccupation with the
involvement of uncertainty and gradedness in metaphor processing. Much
metaphor doesn't so much contribute totally new, black-and-white
information as to contribute to modifying the degree of
intensity of or level of certainty about a state of affairs about which
there may be other evidence.

<H4> GRANT SUPPORT </H4>

The project was supported by Research Project Grant F/00 094/BE
from the <I>Leverhulme Trust</I> [October 2010 to October 2013].

<P>
The project was previously supported by grants from 
from the <I>Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council</I> of the UK
(EPSRC) [the last one was grant no. EP/C538943/1 from 2005 to 2008] and,
prior to that,
grants from the <I>National Science Foundation</I> of the USA.

<! The ATT-Meta project was previously supported by grant GR/M64208 from
the EPSRC, and before that in the USA by grants IRI-9101354 and
CDA-8914670 from the National Science Foundation of the USA.>

<P>
The ATT-Meta work was also an important aspect of the 
e-drama project (2003-2007), supported by a grant (no. RES-328-25-0009) from
the <I>Economic and Social Research Council</I> (ESRC) in association with the
EPSRC and with the  <I>Department of Trade and Industry</I>, under the PACCIT
programme (People at the Centre of Communications and Information
Technologies), which was part of the government's academic/industrial
LINK funding scheme.

<H4>THE NAME OF THE SYSTEM AND HOW TO SAY IT</H4> 

The project, system and theoretical approach are called ``ATT-Meta''
because they are concerned with propositional
<STRONG>ATT</STRONG>itudes and with
<STRONG>Meta</STRONG>phor-based reasoning.

<P>
The name is pronounced like ``atmeta'', not ``a-t-t-meta'' as some
people have thought. If the name sounds like that of an Egyptian
pharaoh, so much the better.

<P> The system has no connection to any famous telecom company in the
USA, as has also been supposed, believe it or not!
