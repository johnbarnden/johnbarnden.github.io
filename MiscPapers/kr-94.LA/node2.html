<P>
Metaphors in discourse affect an understander's task of obtaining a coherent
understanding. This is clear from, e.g., Hobbs (1990), Martin (1990) and
others.  Here we expand on the recipe example given above.  Consider the
discourse fragment (1), and contrast some possible continuations of it, namely
(1a-c):
<P>
<b> (1)</b>
<i>
Veronica was preparing for her dinner party.  Her brother's recipe had said to
fry the mushrooms for one hour.</i>
<P>
 <b> (1a)</b>
<i> She did this even though she believed the recipe to be wrong.</i>
<P>
 <b> (1b)</b>
<i> She did this even though in the recesses of her mind she believed the
recipe to be wrong.</i>
<P>
 <b> (1c)</b>
<i> She did this even though she thought, ``The recipe's wrong.''</i>
<P>
Here (1a) contains an ordinary, non-metaphorical mental state
description.  Sentence (1b) manifests the MIND AS PHYSICAL SPACE conceptual
metaphor, explicitly referring to a specific subregion of the whole ``space''
of the mind. (See, e.g., Lakoff 1993 for the notion of conceptual metaphor as
opposed to mere linguistic manifestations of metaphor.)  Ideas or thinking
episodes in one subregion can be incompatible with ideas in another.  For
instance, one subregion can contain the thought that a recipe is wrong, whereas
another can contain the thought that the recipe is right.  Alternatively,
thoughts in one subregion can simply be absent from another.
<P>
In (1c) we see the conceptual metaphor of IDEAS AS INTERNAL UTTERANCES
(following Barnden 1992).  A thinking episode is portrayed as inner speech
within the agent (or, more rarely, as inner non-speech utterances).  The
thinking episode is necessarily an occurrent event happening at a particular
moment in time (as opposed to a long-term believing), is conscious, is usually
a ``forefront'' thought as opposed to being in the background, and, in cases
like 1c, is usually confident as opposed to being tentative.  We take IDEAS AS
INTERNAL UTTERANCES to be a special case of MIND AS PHYSICAL SPACE, with the
internal utterance being an event that takes place within the ``space'' of the
agent's mind.  MIND AS PHYSICAL SPACE and IDEAS AS INTERNAL UTTERANCES are two
of the metaphors to which we have paid most attention in our work. Two others,
MIND PARTS AS PERSONS and IDEAS AS MODELS, are omitted from this paper for
brevity, but see Barnden (1989, 1992). There are many commonly-used, important
metaphors of mind.  See, for example, Lakoff <i> et al.</i> (1991) (and Barnden
1989, 1992 for further metaphors and citations).
<P>
If one looked only at (1b,c,d) one might dispute the above claims about
metaphor, saying that those sentences just involved canned forms of language.
However, consider the following productive variants of them:
<P>
<b> (1b<IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img1.gif">)</b>
<i> She did this [i.e. followed the instruction] after forcibly shoving the idea
that the recipe was wrong to a murky corner of her mind.</i>
<P>
 <b> (1c<IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img2.gif">)</b>
<i> She did this  even while whining to herself, ``Oh no, this damned recipe's wrong.''</i>
<P>
Consider also the immense potential for further varying these, e.g. using verbs
other than ``shove'' and ``whine'' or physical location phrases other than
``murky corner.''  The most economical explanation of the sense that
(1b<IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img3.gif">,c<IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img4.gif">) and their further variants make is that they appeal to
the metaphors we mentioned above.  Then, for uniformity and continuity, it is a
short step to saying that (1b,c) also manifest those metaphors, though in a
more pallid way.  If one wanted to maintain that (1b) was not metaphorical, one
would have to claim, for instance, that ``recesses,'' and the overwhelming
majority of, if not all, words that can be used to mean physical subregions of
various sorts, also happened to have literal mental meanings.  And, one would
have to account for why the regularities in the way the words are used to
describe the mind are analogous to regularities in their physical usage. An
example of such a regularity is that words such as ``recesses'' and ``corner''
convey related meanings when applied to the mind, much as they do when applied
to physical space. These considerations are similar to the arguments used by
Lakoff (1993).
<P>
(1c) does differ markedly from (1c<IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img5.gif">) in not using an ordinary verb of
speech. However, we make three observations. First, people commonly experience
some thoughts as ``inner speech,'' so that it is fair to take (1c) as saying
that Veronica was experiencing inner speech. Secondly, the verb ``think'' is in
fact often used to portray speech in the following way: ``Veronica thought
aloud that the recipe was wrong.'' Thirdly, the idea that (1c) really is
suggesting speech is reinforced by the effect of introducing the evaluative
adjective ``damned'' into the quotation in (1c).  One might question whether
(1c) implies inner speech as opposed to inner writing.  We plump for speech as
being a far more likely implication, given that it is very common to find
thought-description sentences using phrases such as ``said to himself,''
``debated within herself'', etc., and relatively rare to find ones that convey
inner writing; also, the sentence forms used within the quote marks appear to
be more typical of speech than writing.
<P>

<P>
In (1a--c) there is a disparity between Veronica's obeying the recipe and her
belief in its incorrectness.  The different ways the belief is described lead
to different degrees of plausibility for various possible explanations of the
disparity.  One reasonable interpretation for (1b) is that Veronica's
wrong-recipe belief was only minimally involved, if at all, in her conscious
thinking, so that she did not consciously think (to any significant degree)
that she was following a recipe that was incorrect.

<P>
By contrast, continuation (1c) places the wrong-recipe belief squarely in her
conscious thinking, so it seems much more likely that Veronica deliberately
went against her own strong doubts, for some reason.  For example, she might
have been ordered to follow the recipe.  We are not saying that an explanation
for (1c) could not hold for (1b), or vice versa.  Rather, our point is that the
<i> balance of reasonableness</i> is different between (1c) and (1b).  The
non-metaphorical (1a) is vaguer in its implications than (1b,c), but (1c)-type
explanations seem more likely than (1b)-type ones.
