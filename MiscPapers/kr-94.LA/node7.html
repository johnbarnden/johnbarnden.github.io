<P>
ATT-Meta's reasoning is centered on a goal-directed, backwards-chaining usage
of production rules that link episodes to episodes (rather than formulae to
formulae).  Each rule has the form
<P>
 <tt> <b>&lt;</b>LHS<b>&gt;</b> <IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img24.gif"> [<b>&lt;</b>qualifier<b>&gt;</b>] <b>&lt;</b>RHS<b>&gt;</b></tt>,
<P>
where the LHS is a list of episode-denoting terms (typically of the form <tt>
#ep(...)</tt> possibly containing free variables, the RHS is one such term, and <b>&lt;</b>qualifier<b>&gt;</b> is
one of Suggested, Presumed, or Certain. Also, a term <b>e</b>, or
a sublist of terms on the LHS, can be embedded in a metaphorical cocoon
designator as follows: <tt> [WITHIN-COCOON <IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img25.gif">: <IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img26.gif"> <b>e</b>]</tt>. Here <IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img27.gif"> is
an (agent-denoting) term (usually a variable) and <IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img28.gif"> is the name of a
metaphor such as MIND AS PHYSICAL SPACE.
<P>
An (unrealistic) example of a  rule is
<P>
<PRE><TT>  &#175;<tt> #ep(Loving, <b>t</b>, <b>x</b>, <b>y</b>), #ep(Being-Boy, <b>t</b>, <b>x</b>)</tt>
<P>
      		<IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img29.gif"> <tt> [Presumed] #ep(Being-Hungry, <b>t</b>, <b>x</b>).</tt>
<P>
</TT></PRE>
<P>
This says that any boy who loves something at/over some time t is, presumably, hungry at/over t. Suppose ATT-Meta is investigating the proposition
that Mark is hungry during a time interval denoted by some term <IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img30.gif">.
Then it sets up the episode-term <tt>
#ep(Being-Hungry, <IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img31.gif">, Mark)</tt> as a subgoal.  (We use the term
``proposition'' loosely to mean an episode-denoting term that has either been
given a rating of at least Possible, or is an existing reasoning goal.)  It
finds the above rule, and instantiates its <b>t</b> and <b>x</b> variables to <tt> now</tt>
and <tt> Mark</tt>.  Suppose ATT-Meta already has the formulae
<P>
<PRE><TT>  &#175;<tt> #certain(Loving, <IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img32.gif">, Mark, Mary)</tt>
<P>
      		<tt> #certain(Being-Boy, <IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img33.gif">, Mark).</tt>
<P>
</TT></PRE>
<P>
As a result, ATT-Meta creates the formula <tt>
#presumed(#ep(Being-Hungry, <IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img34.gif">, Mark)).</tt> If there were other rules also
providing evidence for the Mark-hungry goal, then the qualifier assigned would
be the maximum of the qualifiers suggested by the individual rules, where
Suggested is less then Presumed which is less than Certain.
<P>
Also, the LHS terms can match with Suggested and Presumed episodes,
not just Certain ones as in our example. Then the qualifier suggested by
the rule for the RHS episode is the minimum of the certainty levels picked up
by the LHS terms and the <b>&lt;</b>qualifier<b>&gt;</b> in the rule itself. So, if is only
Suggested that Mark loves Mary, then from the rule it would only get a
Suggested rating for Mark being hungry.
<P>
When ATT-Meta investigates a
goal-episode (e.g. Mark being hungry), it automatically investigates its
negation as well. Suppose there are rules that could provide evidence for the
negation (so an RHS could have the form <tt>
#ep-neg(#ep(Being-Hungry, <b>t</b>, <b>x</b>))</tt>.  Let us say that the maximum
of the confidence levels for the original hypothesis is P, and the maximum for
the negated hypothesis is N. (Each of N or P is always at least Suggested.)
Then ATT-Meta proceeds as follows: If P and N are both  Certain, then a
genuine error condition has arisen and ATT-Meta halts.  Otherwise, if one is
Certain, then it prevails and the other goal is deleted.  Otherwise, both
the original goal and its negation are given ratings by the following <i>
rating reconciliation scheme</i>:

if one or both of P, N are Suggested then they are accepted as the
certainty levels of the two hypotheses;

and if P, N are both Presumed, then, unless there is reason to prefer one
presumption over the other, both hypotheses are ``downgraded'' by being given a
rating of Suggested.  Currently, the only way in which a one presumption can be
preferred over another is through a <i> specificity comparison heuristic</i>.
<P>
We are actively investigating the question of how to compare
specificity.  We describe here one crude, preliminary
approach that we are experimenting with. The defined more-specific-than
relation is irreflexive and antisymmetric, but it is not transitive and is
therefore not a partial order. It is not yet clear how important this
deficiency is.
<P>
Let R be a rule that contributed a Presumed rating to a proposition P.  Then
the set of propositions to which R was applied is an <i> immediate basis</i> (IB)
for P.  Also, if P is a given proposition, then one IB for P is just <IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img35.gif">P<IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img36.gif">.
It may have other IBs because a given proposition may also be supported by
rules.
<P>
With Q as above, we give preference to Q over <IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img37.gif"> if the
support for Q is more <i> Q-specific</i> than the support for <IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img38.gif">.  The support for a proposition S1 is more Q-specific than the support for
a proposition S2 <i> iff</i> some IB for S1 is more Q-specific than some IB for
S2 and not less Q-specific than any IB for S2, <i> and</i> any IB for S2 that is
more Q-specific than some for S1 is also less Q-specific than some for S1.
(Our more-specific-than relation is relative to Q because of condition (b)
below.  ``Q-specific'' is synonymous with ``<IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img39.gif">-specific.'')
)
<P>
IB1 is more Q-specific than IB2 <i> iff</i> each proposition P in IB2 is either in
IB1 or less Q-specific than IB1 <i> and</i> there is a proposition in
IB1<IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img40.gif">IB2 that is not less Q-specific than IB2.  Proposition P is less
Q-specific than proposition set IB <i> iff</i>
<P>
(a) P can be derived just from IB but the propositions in IB cannot all be
derived just from P; or:
<P>
(b) neither of P, IB can be derived just from the other, and some proposition
in IB is ``closer'' to Q than P is (see below); or:
<P>
(c) neither of P, IB can be derived just from the other, P is incomparable as
to Q-closeness with each proposition in IB, and the support for P is less
Q-specific than the support for some proposition in IB.
<P>
P1 is <i> closer</i> than P2 to Q under the following conditions:
<P>
(b1) Q is about (exactly) one agent X's mental state, P1 is about X's mental state, but P2
is not; or
<P>
(b2) Q is about one agent X's mental state, P1 is about X, but P2 is not.
<P>
Derivability in (a) is examined using heuristically limited techniques; and
note that the derivability check is a matter of examining the implementation's
inter-proposition dependency links rather than undertaking more reasoning. The
recursion introduced by (c) must be limited because of circularities, notably
those introduced by <IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img41.gif">P<IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img42.gif"> being an IB of P when P is a given proposition.
Provision (b) is closely tailored to the purposes of ATT-Meta, but it is a
special case of a general principle: <i> if one is trying to establish
something, Q, and some proposition P1 is closer in subject matter to Q than
some other proposition P2 is, then one should tend to give more weight to P1
than to P2.</i> In turn, this general principle is a natural generalization of the
normal overriding-of-inheritance principle commonly employed in semantic
networks. For a given node, closer ancestors are closer in subject matter to
the node than more distant ancestors are. Aboutness in (b1,2) is assessed in a
simple, crude way.
<P>
As an example of the use of the Q-specificity heuristic, consider the
hypothesis in the (1--1c) example in section 2 that 

<P>
Veronica consciously believed that the recipe was wrong. 

Let this be Q. Q gets an initial
Presumed rating only via rule R.1 from the propositions that (i) she followed
the recipe and (ii) she believed the recipe to be wrong. Here (i) is a given
proposition (with no rule-based support) and (ii) is derived by one rule
application from the given proposition that (iii) she believed in the recesses
of her mind that the recipe was wrong. On the other hand, not-Q (i.e.
<IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img43.gif">) gets an initial Presumed rating from (iii) via TR.5 only.
So, the only IB for Q is <IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img44.gif">(i),(ii)<IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img45.gif"> and the only IB for not-Q is
<IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img46.gif">(iii)<IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img47.gif">.  Here (ii) is less Q-specific than <IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img48.gif">(iii)<IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img49.gif"> since (ii) is
derivable from just (iii) (but not vice versa). Also, (i) is less Q-specific
than <IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img50.gif">(iii)<IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img51.gif"> by condition (b1) above. It is also easy to see that (iii)
is not less Q-specific than <IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img52.gif">(i),(ii)<IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img53.gif">.  Therefore, <IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img54.gif">'s only IB is more Q-specific than Q's only IB, and only Q is downgraded to
Suggested.
<P>
Finally, we can only briefly mention an important truth-maintenance algorithm
used in the implementation.  Because of the common phenomenon of circularities
in the inter-hypothesis derivation graph, and because of the above downgrading
of Presumed ratings to Suggested, ATT-Meta must sometimes traverse parts of the
graph, adjusting confidence ratings in order to satisfy some constraints. The
updating is done lazily (i.e., on demand). (Cf. the lazy type of ATMS studied
by Kelleher &amp; van der Gaag 1993).
