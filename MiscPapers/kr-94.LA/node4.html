<P>
We take (1--1a) first.  It is given that Veronica followed the recipe.
(ATT-Meta currently always trusts the discourse sentences to be true.)
ATT-Meta infers from this that
<P>
<b> (2)</b> <i> presumably, Veronica consciously believed she was following it</i>
<P>
via a rule that says that if someone does an action then (s)he is, presumably,
conscious of doing so.  It is also given that Veronica believes the recipe to
be wrong.  From this ATT-Meta uses simulative reasoning (SR) to infer that
<P>
<b> (3)</b> <i> presumably, she believed it was not  good to follow it.</i>
<P>
(We use ``not good'' here in the sense of ``not conducive to achieving the
recipe's normal purpose.'')  The process is basically as follows.  In a special
Veronica-simulation environment, ATT-Meta adopts the premise that <i> the
recipe is wrong</i>.  We call this environment a <i> simulation pretence cocoon.</i>
Using a rule that says that if a body of instructions is wrong it is not good
to follow it, ATT-Meta infers within the cocoon that
<P>
<b> (3<IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img6.gif">)</b>: <i> it is not good to follow the recipe</i>.
<P>
Concomitantly, ATT-Meta infers (3).  Further, within the cocoon
ATT-Meta adopts the following premise, because of (2):
<P>
<b> (2<IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img7.gif">)</b>: <i> Veronica follows the recipe</i>.<A NAME=tex2html1 HREF="footnode.html#49"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://cbl.leeds.ac.uk/nikos/figs//foot_motif.gif"></A>

  
<P>
Then, within the cocoon ATT-Meta infers the conjunction of (2<IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img8.gif">) and
(3<IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img9.gif">), namely
<P>
<b> (4<IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img10.gif">)</b>: <i> Veronica 
follows the recipe AND it's not good to follow the recipe.</i>
<P>
Concomitantly, it infers that, presumably, Veronica believes this conjunction.
Notice here that an SR conclusion such as this one or (3) is always qualified by
``presumably,'' reflecting the fact that ATT-Meta merely presumes that the
agent does the necessary inferencing.
<P>
Now, ATT-Meta has the following  rule:
<P>
<b> (R.1)</b> IF <i> someone is following a set
of instructions and believes it to be wrong</i> THEN,
presumably, <i> (s)he <i> consciously</i> believes that.</i>

<P>
Therefore, ATT-Meta infers that Veronica's belief in
the wrongness of the recipe was presumably conscious. Thus, both
premises used in the simulation cocoon (namely: <i> the recipe is wrong</i>; <i>
Veronica follows the recipe</i>) reflect conscious beliefs of Veronica's. As
a result, ATT-Meta presumes that any belief resulting from the simulation is
also conscious. Therefore, the main result of the belief reasoning  is
<P>
<b> (4)</b> <i> presumably, Veronica <b> consciously</b> believed that: she follows the
recipe AND it's not  good to follow the recipe.</i>
<P>
This feeds into a rule that can be paraphrased as follows:
<P>
<b> (R.2)</b> IF <i> agent X does action A and consciously believes that [(s)he does A AND
it's not good to do A]</i> THEN, presumably, <i> the explanation is that (s)he
has a special reason for doing A despite having that conscious belief.</i>
<P>
Thus, ATT-Meta is able to infer the main result of the example, namely:
<P>
<b> (5)</b> <i> presumably, Veronica had a special reason for following the recipe even
though consciously believing that [she's following the recipe AND it is not
good to follow it].</i>
