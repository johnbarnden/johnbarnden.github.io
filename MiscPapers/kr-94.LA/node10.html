<P>
ATT-Meta differs from other work on belief representation/reasoning mainly by
taking account of the important phenomenon of metaphorical descriptions of
mental states in discourse. In particular, these descriptions can clarify the
way in which an agent believes something (as opposed to specifying what is
believed). Such ways of believing can make a major difference in discourse
understanding, for instance by explaining how agents can fail to see
consequences of their beliefs.  Also, ATT-Meta is unique in having a systematic
and well-motivated way of constraining the application of SR, namely by
integrating it with metaphor-based reasoning.  The SR and metaphor-based
reasoning are completely integrated into a powerful and practical
uncertain/defeasible reasoning framework. The SR is unusual in distinguishing
conscious belief as an important special case.
<P>
ATT-Meta is one of the few implemented, or detailed theoretical, schemes for
significant metaphor-based reasoning. (Others are Hobbs 1990 and Martin 1990.)
We integrate metaphor-based reasoning into an uncertain reasoning framework
much as Hobbs does, except that he uses abductive framework.  In addition, our
scheme for metaphor-based reasoning is much like that of Hobbs, in that it
usually proceeds by applying concepts and rules from the metaphor vehicle
directly to the target items, rather than by translating them into
target-domain concepts and rules. Some of the advantages of the approach are
discussed in Barnden (1992).  ATT-Meta differs from Hobbs' and Martin's work in
being concerned only with metaphors of mind.  Nevertheless, there is nothing in
our approach that is peculiar to metaphors of mind, as opposed to metaphors for
other abstract matters.  ATT-Meta currently handles only metaphor that is
conventional to it. Our work therefore differs from, e.g., that of Fass (1991)
and Iverson &amp; Helmreich (1992), who are concerned with working out the nature of
novel(to-the-system) metaphors encountered in sentences.
<P>
Nevertheless, ATT-Meta can be creative in its use of any given metaphor,
because any source-domain fact or rule can be opportunistically used during
metaphor-based reasoning. For example, consider the sentence ``One part of
Veronica was insisting that the recipe was wrong.'' We take this to exhibit
what we call the MIND PARTS AS PERSONS metaphor.  Given that a normal inference
from the fact that a real person insists something that some interlocutor of
that person has said something that conflicts with it, ATT-Meta can conclude
(within a metaphorical pretence cocoon) that some non-mentioned part of
Veronica has said that the recipe was correct, and therefore presumably
believes this. Notice that <i> there is no need here for any transfer rule to
impinge on the notion of insisting.</i> In this way, all the richness of metaphor
vehicle (source) domains is available for use.  This point is strengthened by
the fact that the knowledge bases we have built up for the metaphor vehicles
are not contrived for metaphorical use, but are designed to support ordinary
reasoning within those domains. For instance, the physical rules in section 3
are commonsensical rules that are useful for ordinary physical reasoning.
<P>
In future work, we hope to address the following issues among others:

a formal Q-specification of the intended interpretation of the episodic logic;

a more powerful  specificity heuristic;

and

a more sophisticated treatment of Certain/Certain clashes within SR --- e.g.,
one possibility is for the system to <i> postulate</i> a MIND AS PHYSICAL SPACE
view of the agent, even if this is not directly indicated by the discourse, and
then place the clashing propositions in different mind regions.  Also, ATT-Meta
provides a promising framework for various interesting ways of nesting
different types of reasoning.  The nesting of metaphor-based within simulative
reasoning allows the ascription of metaphorical thinking about mental states to
agents. This is a useful addition to ordinary nested belief reasoning. The
nesting of belief reasoning, including SR, within metaphor-based reasoning
allows SR to be applied to metaphorical ``persons'' in a metaphor vehicle. The
nesting of metaphor-based reasoning inside itself allows the handling of
chained metaphor (where aspects of a metaphor vehicle are themselves conceived
metaphorically).
<P>
In this work we have had to adopt provisional solutions to a number of
difficult problems, both in representation and reasoning, aside from SR and
metaphor-based reasoning themselves. For example, we have had to deal with the
de-dicto/de-re distinction, indexicality in beliefs, complex episodes,
representation of time and causality, and defeasible reasoning.  Our solutions
to these issues are to some extent orthogonal to the main principles of
simulative and metaphor-based reasoning that we have adopted, and are subject
to change.
