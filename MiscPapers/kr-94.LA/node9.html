<P>
Hypotheses of form (I.Q) above (or, of course, I.<IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img153.gif">)
introduced by steps (B.1) and (B.2) of SR provide a means whereby
meta-reasoning about an agent's individual reasoning steps can be applied to
affect the course of SR.  Such reasoning might downgrade or upgrade those
hypotheses, thus affecting the strength of the conclusions reached by rules
such as (R.Q). We have studied metaphor-based reasoning that affects (in fact,
only ever downgrades) the hypotheses (I.Q), but, in principle, non-metaphorical
reasoning could also do so. In particular, limitations on the amount of
reasoning the agent is assumed to be able to do could be brought into the
picture.
<P>
We concentrate here on the effect of metaphor on hypotheses (I.Q), but a
metaphor-based inference can also say something direct about an agent's belief.
For instance, in section 3, an IDEAS AS INTERNAL UTTERANCES inference directly
produced the conclusion that a particular belief was conscious.
<P>
When a hypothesis (I.Q) is created, one sort of rule that might attack it (i.e.
support its negation) is a metaphorical ``transfer'' rule such as TR.2 in
section 3.  Through the ordinary process of backwards rule usage, this causes
subgoals to be set up inside the (X,M) metaphorical pretence cocoon specified
by the rule, if that cocoon exists. Here X is the agent and M is the name of
the metaphor.  A special action is to try to establish whether the cocoon
exists.  Currently, the cocoon only exists if a metaphorical belief
representation (as at the end of section 4) has been set up as a direct
result of one the sentences in the input discourse. If the cocoon does not
exist, then the transfer rule fails.  If the cocoon does exist, then the
presence of a proposition P within it is simply noted in the implementation by
tagging a copy of P with (X,M).  When the cocoon is created, one or more <i>
standard premises</i> are inserted.  For instance, if M is MIND AS PHYSICAL SPACE,
then the cocoon will contain the Certain premise that X's mind is a physical
space.  Also, other premises resulting directly from the input discourse can be
inserted.  For instance, the discourse might say that a particular idea is in
X's mind. We call these <i> discourse premises for the cocoon</i>. Currently all
such premises are Certain.
<P>
Reasoning within the cocoon is as normal, with a small but important change to
the rating-reconciliation scheme. The reasoning within the cocoon (i.e.
mediating between (X,M)-tagged propositions) can use any of ATT-Meta's rules,
but because of its goal-directedness it will ordinarily just use rules peculiar
to the vehicle domain of M. Subgoals resulting from within-cocoon rule
consideration can also be addressed (supported or attacked) by transfer rules.
In turn, these rules can lead to rule consideration entirely outside the
cocoon. In this way, metaphor-based reasoning is intimately and
context-sensitively combined with non-metaphorical reasoning.
<P>
Knowledge outside the cocoon can conflict with knowledge inside, as pointed out
in section 3. For instance, ATT-Meta may have the rule (R) that a mind is
Certainly not a physical space. This rule's Certain conclusion in X's case
would conflict with the standard premise mentioned above as being in the
cocoon.  To handle this problem, we simply make the following change to the
rating-reconciliation scheme as used within the cocoon: when considering a
subgoal Q and its complement <IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img154.gif"> where the preliminary rating
for the latter is Certain, if Q has support (however indirectly) from a
standard cocoon premise, discourse premise for the cocoon, and/or transfer
rules, whereas <IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img155.gif"> does not have such support, then the
Certain rating for <IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img156.gif"> is first downgraded to Presumed.
(Notice that this does not affect cases where both or neither of Q,
<IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img157.gif"> have support of the type mentioned.)  As a result, the
ordinary operation of ATT-Meta's rating reconciliation scheme can cause the
downgrading of <IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img158.gif"> to Suggested only, or its elimination.
Elimination would happen with Q being that X's mind is a physical space, since
this is a standard cocoon premise and therefore Certain. This defeats
<IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img159.gif">'s original Certain rating because that is first downgraded
to Presumed.
<P>
Finally, observe that there may be more than one hypothesis (I.Q) for a given
Q, because Q may be supported within SR in more than one way.  It could be that
metaphor-based reasoning only downgrades one such hypothesis.  Then, the rating
of the proposition [X believes-<IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img160.gif"> Q] supported by rules of form R.Q is not,
after all, affected. Also, in principle, an (I.Q) could have completely
independent support from non-metaphorical, non-simulative reasoning, and this
support might defeat the support from metaphor-based reasoning.
