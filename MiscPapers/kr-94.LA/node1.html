<P>
In spoken and written discourse, mental states and processes are often
described with the aid of commonsense models of mind. These models are largely
metaphorical, and the metaphorical descriptions often convey information, about
the quality of the mental states, that is important for understanding the
discourse.  In particular, the descriptions can clarify how agents can fail to
draw even quite obvious conclusions from their beliefs.  Accordingly, as a step
towards making mental state reasoning more realistic, refined and powerful, we
have developed a system, ATT-Meta, for reasoning about mental states reported
in small fragments of discourse, paying attention to metaphorical descriptions.
The reasoning part of the system currently has an advanced prototype
implementation in Quintus Prolog.
<P>
As an example of the phenomena of interest, consider the following passage:
<i> Veronica was preparing for her dinner party.  Her brother's recipe had
said to fry the mushrooms for one hour. She did this even though in the
recesses of her mind she believed the recipe to be wrong.</i> We claim that this
last sentence manifests the conceptual metaphor of MIND AS PHYSICAL SPACE.
Under this metaphor, the mind is a physical space within which ideas or
thinking events/situations can lie at particular locations. The ideas and
thinkings are often themselves conceived metaphorically as physical objects,
events or situations. As we will see below, the use of this metaphor in the
passage makes a considerable difference to what it can be reasonably taken to
convey.  It metaphor affects the balance of reasonableness between possible
explanations of the disparity between Veronica's following of the recipe and
her belief that it was wrong. If no metaphor, or a different one, had been
used, then the balance would have been different.
<P>
ATT-Meta's main contributions are that it enriches mental state
representation/reasoning by bringing in the commonsense models of mental states
that people actually use, and it integrates metaphor-based reasoning about
mental states with simulative reasoning (SR) about mental states. It thereby
constrains SR in useful and novel ways.
<P>
The plan of the paper is as follows.

Section 2 expands on the role of metaphor in discourse understanding.

Section 3 informally sketches the reasoning ATT-Meta  does on some example discourse fragments.

Sections 4 to 7 provide many representation and reasoning details underlying the account in section 3.
The present paper is a natural sequel to Barnden (1989, 1992).
