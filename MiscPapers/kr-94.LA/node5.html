<P>
We now turn to (1--1c), which involves simpler reasoning than (1--1b) does.
ATT-Meta's general approach to metaphor is to ``pretend'' to take a
metaphorical utterance at face value (i.e literally).  That is, in the case
of (1c), ATT-Meta pretends that
<P>
(P) <i> there was a <i> real</i> utterance of ``The recipe's wrong'' within Veronica's mind,</i>
<P>
where also ATT-Meta pretends Veronica's mind was a PHYSICAL SPACE.  The
pretences are embodied as the adoption of P as a premise within a special
environment that we call a <i> metaphorical pretence cocoon</i> for
Veronica's-IDEAS AS INTERNAL UTTERANCES.  Now, the real force of such cocoons
is that inference can take place within them, much as within simulation
cocoons. This will happen for (1--1b). However, in the present example, the
only important action that ATT-Meta bases on the metaphor is to use the
following ``transfer rule'' linking certain metaphorical cocoons to reality:
<P>
 <b> (TR.1)</b> IF [within a cocoon for agent X's-IDEAS AS INTERNAL
UTTERANCES <i> there is an utterance of a declarative sentence S within X's
mind</i>] THEN, presumably, <i> X consciously believes the proposition stated by
S.</i>
<P>
Thus, ATT-Meta infers that, presumably, Veronica consciously believed the
recipe to be wrong.  Thus, the remainder of the reasoning is essentially the
same as that for (1--1a), and ATT-Meta again constructs the main result
(5). (There is a sense in which (5) is more
strongly supported in the (1--1c) case than in the (1--1a) case, because of
general principles concerning the specificity of inferences. However, this
matter is still under investigation.)
<P>
Notice that it is only within the metaphorical pretence cocoon that ATT-Meta
takes Veronica's mind to be a physical space. ATT-Meta could have information
outside the cocoon saying or implying that no mind is a physical space.
However, this generalization, as instantiated to Veronica, is overridden by the
proposition within the cocoon that Veronica's mind is a physical space. (The
reason for this is given below.)  Also, propositions about Veronica's mind
within the cocoon have no effect on reasoning outside the cocoon unless
explicitly exported by a transfer rule. Thus, the within-cocoon proposition
that Veronica's mind is a physical space does not cause trouble outside the
cocoon.
<P>
In case (1--1c), the metaphor-based reasoning was minimal, and furthermore did
not interact with SR very much.  Things are markedly
different in the case of (1--1b).  ATT-Meta still tries to do the same
SR about Veronica as above. However, one of the steps, namely
the one that constructs the conjunction (4<IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img11.gif">) within the simulation cocoon, is
blocked from occurring.  The reason for this is as follows.
<P>
Suppose ATT-Meta comes to a within-cocoon conclusion Q, and that this was
directly based on within-cocoon  propositions  Q1, ..., Qn.   ATT-Meta concomitantly
sets up the external conclusion that the agent (X) presumably believes Q, as was
implied above.  However, another action is to record that this conclusion is
dependent upon the hypothesis that
<P>
 <b> (I)</b> <i> X performs an inference step yielding Q from  Q1, ..., Qn.</i>
<P>
This hypothesis is, normally, deemed by ATT-Meta to be <i> presumably</i> true.
It turns out that for examples (1--1a) and (1--c) there is nothing that defeats
this presumption.  However, one use of metaphor-based reasoning in ATT-Meta is
precisely to defeat presumptions of form (I). If an instance of I is defeated
then ATT-Meta abandons the conclusion that X presumably believes Q (unless Q
has other support, e.g. other instances of I). If ATT-Meta abandons this
conclusion then it concomitantly abolishes Q within the simulation cocoon.  Two
instances of I are set up in case (1--1b):
<P>
<b> (I.1)</b> <i> Veronica performed an inference step yielding [it is
not  good to follow the recipe] from [the recipe is wrong]</i>;
<P>
<b> (I.2)</b> <i> Veronica performed an inference step yielding [Veronica
follows the recipe AND it is not  good to follow the recipe] from
[Veronica follows the recipe] and [it is not good to follow the recipe].</i>
<P>
Now, part of ATT-Meta's understanding of the MIND AS PHYSICAL SPACE metaphor is:
<P>
<b> (TR.2)</b> <i> X's performing an inference process yielding Q from Q1, ..., Qn corresponds
metaphorically to Q1, ..., Qn <b> physically interacting</b> within X's mind
space to produce Q.</i> (If n is 1 then Q arises just out of Q1, without an interaction
with something else.)
<P>
 This principle is couched in a set of transfer rules
analogous in form to TR.1. 
In addition, ATT-Meta has a rule <i> purely about
physical interactions</i> that says
<P>
<b> (R.3)</b> 
IF <i> some things are spatially separated from each other, rather than being
close together,</i> THEN, presumably, <i> they do not interact.</i>
<P>
Another purely physical rule is
<P>
<b> (R.4)</b> 
IF <i> Q1,..., Qn physically interact to produce Q and the Pi are all within a
particular region R,</i> THEN, presumably, <i> Q is in R.</i>
<P>
Other parts of ATT-Meta's understanding of the metaphor are the
following transfer principles:
<P>
<b> (TR.3)</b> 
<i> X believing P corresponds to the thinking-that-P being at some position in
X's mind-space</i>;
<P>
<b> (TR.4)</b> 
<i> X consciously believing P corresponds to X's mind having a front region and
the thinking-that-P being in that region</i>;
<P>
<b> (TR.5)</b> 
IF <i> a thinking occurs in the recesses of X's mind</i> THEN, presumably, <i> it is not conscious.</i>
<P>
ATT-Meta sets up a metaphorical pretence cocoon for Veronica's-MIND AS PHYSICAL
SPACE.  ATT-Meta takes (1b) at face value and adopts the within-cocoon premise
that in the recesses of this space there was the thought that the recipe is
wrong. As before, ATT-Meta performs the SR step that
concludes, within the simulation cocoon, that it is not good to follow the
recipe. Hence, by TR.2 it also infers that, within Veronica's mind-space, the
thought that the recipe is wrong <i> physically produced</i> the thought that it
is not good to follow it.  By R.4, it follows that the latter thought was also
in the <i> recesses</i> of Veronica's mind.
<P>
However, ATT-Meta infers as in (1--1a) that presumably Veronica consciously
believed that she was following the recipe. Hence, by TR.4, the thought that
Veronica follows the recipe was in the <i> front</i> of her mind.  ATT-Meta takes
the front and the recesses to be distant from each other (relative to the size
of the mind-space). Therefore, ATT-Meta uses R.3 within the metaphorical
pretence cocoon to infer that the thought that Veronica follows the recipe did
<i> not</i> interact with the thought that it is not good to follow the recipe.
Via TR.2, this undermines I.2. As a result, the conjunction (4<IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img12.gif">) [Veronica follows
the recipe AND it is not good to follow the recipe] is abolished from the
SR cocoon. Concomitantly, the proposition that Veronica
believed this conjunction is abolished. (I.1, on the other hand, is not
undermined.)
<P>
Recall that in (1--1a) ATT-Meta inferred that, presumably, Veronica <i>
consciously</i> believed the recipe to be wrong. This inference is attempted also
in case (1--1b).  However, it is defeated indirectly by the given information
that the thought that the recipe was wrong was in the <i> recesses</i> of her
mind, which supports via TR.5 the hypothesis that the belief was <i> not</i>
conscious.  This support for this hypothesis is judged to be more specific, and
therefore stronger, than the support for the hypothesis that the belief was
conscious.
<P>
All in all, (4) is defeated in case (1--1b) --- ATT-Meta does <i> not</i>
conclude it.  In fact, because of a closed-world provision about belief in
section 6, ATT-Meta comes to the stronger conclusion that Veronica actually
failed to believe the conjunction (4<IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img13.gif">).  This then allows the following
rule to proceed:
<P>
<b> (R.5)</b> IF <i> agent X does action A, believes that it's not 
good to do A, but fails to believe that [X does A AND it's not 
good to do A]</i> THEN, presumably, <i> this failure explains the apparent disparity
between X's action and belief.</i>
<P>
Thus, ATT-Meta is able to infer the main result of the example, namely:
<P>
<b> (6)</b> <i> presumably, the explanation for the apparent disparity
concerning Veronica is that she failed to believe that [Veronica follows the
recipe AND the recipe is wrong].</i>
<P>
Finally, it turns out that ATT-Meta does arrive at some <i> weak</i> support for (6)
in cases (1--1a) and (1--1c), and conversely comes up with some weak support for (5)
in case (1--1b). This reflects our point in section 2 that the metaphors affect
the balance of reasonableness of explanations, and do not totally discount
particular explanations.
