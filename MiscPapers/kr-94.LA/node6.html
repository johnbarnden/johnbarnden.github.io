<P>
ATT-Meta's representations are expressions in a first-order logic with equality
and with set description devices (that are syntactic sugar for first-order
expressions). The logic is episodic, in that terms can denote ``episodes'' and
sets of them.  Our logical representations are similar in spirit to those of
Hobbs (1990), Schubert &amp; Hwang (1990) and Wilensky (1991). They are,
overall, closest to Wilensky's, but the treatment of belief is similar to Hobbs'
and different from those of Wilensky and Schubert &amp; Hwang.  In common with
Schubert &amp; Hwang, we take an episode to be any sort of situation, event or
process. An episode has a time, which can be an instant, a bounded interval,
or an unbounded interval.  Time instants and time intervals are just objects
in the domain (of the intended interpretation), just like any other object. We
have no space here to go into the detail of the handling of time or causation,
and in any case ATT-Meta's reasoning about time is currently limited.
The detail we do give here is just what is most directly relevant to the aim of
this paper (i.e. to explain ATT-Meta's mixing of belief reasoning and
metaphor-based reasoning).
<P>
Objects in the domain can be ``non-certain'' or ``certain.'' For instance, the
episode of John kissing Mary at <b>&lt;</b>some time<b>&gt;</b> could be non-certain. That is,
ATT-Meta would not take the kissing to be necessarily real.  The basic type of
term for denoting an episode is illustrated by:
<P>
 <tt> #ep(Kissing, <IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img14.gif">, John, Mary).</tt>
<P>
<tt> Kissing</tt> denotes the set of all conceivable kissing episodes.  <IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img15.gif"> is
some term denoting a specific time interval, and the other arguments denote
particular entities (which can be non-certain).  We assume that a kissing
episode is uniquely specified by the time interval and the identity of the
participants.  If a kissing episode has other aspects, for instance a manner,
then these can be specified on the side, as i: <tt> <b>e</b> = #ep(Kissing,
...) <IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img16.gif"> manner(<b>e</b>) = lovingly</tt>, for some constant or variable <b>e</b>.
<P>
Episodes with the same time as each other can be compounded by conjunction and
disjunction, using function symbols <tt> #ep-conj</tt> and <tt> #ep-disj</tt>. 
For example, the  term
<P>
<PRE><TT>  <tt> #ep-conj(</tt>&#175;<tt> #ep(Being-Happy, <IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img17.gif">, John),</tt>
<P>
                      		<tt> #ep(Being-Sad, <IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img18.gif">, Bill))</tt>
<P>
</TT></PRE>
<P>
denotes the episode of John being happy and Bill being sad at/over <IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img19.gif">.
Episode disjunction and negation is similar.  There is also a way for
expressing quantificational episodes, such as the episode of John loving each
of his sisters over interval i, or the episode of some person in a given room
laughing at John during interval i.  The quantificational apparatus is simple,
but its design required attention to subtleties raised by having to allow for
non-certain episodes and other entities.  For instance, the episode of all dogs
being happy over interval <IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img20.gif"> must be defined independently of which
entities really are dogs (according to ATT-Meta) but must instead map all
conceivable being-a-dog situations to corresponding being-happy situations.
<P>
Non-certain entities episodes can have the status of <i> Possible</i>, <i>
Suggested</i> or <i> Presumed</i>.  <i> Possible</i> means that the episode may be
real (its negation is not certain). <i> Suggested</i> means there is some reason
to think the episode is real.  <i> Presumed</i> means ATT-Meta is presuming the
episode is real. These degrees of uncertainty are stated by means of
predications such as <tt>
#presumed(#ep(Kissing,...)).</tt><A NAME=tex2html2 HREF="footnode.html#161"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://cbl.leeds.ac.uk/nikos/figs//foot_motif.gif"></A>

  
Any formulae at the top level in the system are (implicitly) certain --- it is
only episodes (and other domain entities) that are qualified as to certainty.
<P>
We now turn to mental states, concentrating here exclusively on the central
case of belief. We have several modes of belief representation, one default 
mode and various different modes corresponding to different metaphors of mind
used in mental state descriptions. The default mode is used, for instance, when
a belief is reported non-metaphorically, as in ``Bill believes that John was
ill on <b>&lt;</b>some date<b>&gt;</b>.''  Under the default mode, this state of belief is cast as
an episode of Bill being in a particular relationship to the episode of John
being ill on the date in question. The formula we use is
<P>
<PRE><TT> <tt> #certain(</tt>
<P>
 <tt> #ep(#Belie</tt>&#175;<tt> ving-Certain, now, Bill,</tt>
<P>
                        		<tt> #ep(Being-Ill, John, <IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img21.gif">)))</tt>
<P>
</TT></PRE>
<P>
where <IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img22.gif"> denotes the time interval for the specified date, <tt> now</tt>
denotes some time interval including the current instant, and
<tt> #Certain-Believing</tt> denotes the set of all conceivable episodes of an
agent believing something with certainty. Notice the two different layers
of certainty qualification: ATT-Meta has one degree of certainty that Bill
had the belief, and Bill, if he does have the belief, has his own degree
of certainty. The two layers are independent, so that we might
alternatively have
<P>
<PRE><TT> <tt> #suggested(</tt>
<P>
 <tt> #ep(#Belie</tt>&#175;<tt> ving-Presumed, now, Bill,</tt>
<P>
                        		<tt> #ep(Being-Ill, John, <IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img23.gif">)))</tt>.
<P>
</TT></PRE>
<P>
Note that we take Bill's being certain of something as implying that he
presumes it (i.e. he ``believes-presumed'' it), and believing-presumed
similarly implies believing-suggested.  Conscious belief is represented
similarly, but using episode kinds <tt>
#Consciously-Believing-Certain</tt>, etc.
<P>
Finally, we sketch the most important aspect of the representation, which is
how ATT-Meta expresses belief states that are described metaphorically in the
input discourse. The basic principle here is that of <i> metaphor-infused
representation</i>. That is, ATT-Meta pretends to take the metaphorical descriptions
literally, and uses the ordinary episode kinds that are used within the
source domain (or ``vehicle'') of the metaphor. For example, consider the
sentence, <i> The idea that Sally is clever is in Xavier's mind.</i> In line with
our comments on the productivity of metaphor in section 2, we take this sentence
to be a manifestation of MIND AS PHYSICAL SPACE.  The encoding of the sentence is
<P>
<PRE><TT> <tt> [WITHIN Xavier's-MIND AS PHYSICAL SPACE cocoon</tt>
<P>
<tt> #certain(</tt>
<P>
 <tt> #</tt>&#175;<tt> ep-conj(</tt>
<P>
              		<tt> #ep(Being-Physical-Object-Type, t, i),</tt>
<P>
              		<tt> #ep(Being-Physical-Space, t, m),</tt>
<P>
              		<tt> #ep(Being-Mind-Of, t, m, Xavier),</tt>
<P>
              		<tt> #ep(Inst-Being-Physically-In, t,i,m),</tt>
<P>
              		<tt> #ep(Being-</tt>&#175;<tt> Agent's-Certain-Idea-Of,t,Xavier,i,</tt>
<P>
              		                 		<tt> #ep(Being-Clever,t,Sally))).</tt>
<P>
<tt> ]</tt>
<P>
</TT></PRE>
<P>
where <tt> t, i</tt>, etc. are Skolem constants.  Here <tt>
Inst-Being-Physically-In</tt> is the set of all conceivable situations of an
instance of some physical-object type being <i> physically</i> in something.  The
idea (denoted by <tt> i</tt>) of Sally's (certainly) being clever is stated to be a
physical-object type, Xavier's mind (<tt> m</tt>) is stated to be a physical space,
and and instance of <tt> i</tt> is stated to be physically in <tt> m</tt>.
<P>
We therefore do <i> not</i> represent the meaning of the sentence by translating
the metaphorical input into non-metaphorical internal representations: the
internal representations are themselves metaphorical.  Note that we are not
saying that ATT-Meta really believes that, say, an idea is a physical-object
type --- in a sense ATT-Meta merely pretends temporarily to believe it, because
the representation is within the stated cocoon.
<P>
Below, two propositions are <i> complements</i> iff one is the negation of the
other.  Also, a <i> given proposition</i> is either a piece of knowledge in
ATT-Meta's own knowledge base or is a proposition derived directly from the
discourse.  In the latter case it has a rating of Certain.
