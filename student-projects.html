<UL>
<P><LI>
I'm only prepared to be involved if
there is <B><FONT COLOR=RED>a very close match with my
interests,</FONT></B>

which are largely in the areas of

  <UL>
  <P><LI> processing of <B><FONT COLOR=GREEN>FIGURATIVE ASPECTS OF COMMUNICATION</FONT></B> (metaphor, metonymy,
  hyperbole, irony, ...) -- 
  <BR>but note that these don't have to be in
  linguistic utterances but could instead be in pictures, diagrams, gestures,
  music, ...

  <P><LI> the nature of <B><FONT
  COLOR=GREEN>(SELF-)CONSCIOUSNESS,</FONT></B> 
          <BR>and how to achieve it in artefacts.

  <P> However, feel free to contact me about other topics, just in case.
