<TITLE>Selected Publications: CONNECTIONISM AND ANALOGY </TITLE>


<P><STRONG>This page contains publications on the relationship between
connectionism and ANALOGY.
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
(Since analogy is strongly related to
metaphor, some of the publications therefore implicitly address METAPHOR
as well.)

</STRONG>

<P>

The papers emanate from research that was in part supported by grants from
AFOSR, NSF and NASA.


<P>
Other pages list publications about connectionism but not analogy.
